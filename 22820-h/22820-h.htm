<h1><a name="THE_CROOKED_HOUSE" id="THE_CROOKED_HOUSE"></a>THE CROOKED HOUSE</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Strange Riddle</span></p>


<p>"Monsieur Tranter! A
moment!"</p>

<p>The Right-Honorable John
Tranter swung round, latch-key
in hand. Behind him, an enormous figure
emerged, with surprisingly agile and noiseless
steps, from the shadow of the adjoining house&mdash;a
figure almost grotesque and monstrous in
the dim light of the street lamp. The very
hugeness of the apparition was so disconcerting
that John Tranter drew back with a startled
exclamation.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Monsieur Dupont? You in
London?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont described circles with his
country's largest silk hat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
"I in London! An event, my friend, in the
history of your city!"</p>

<p>He laughed softly, and replaced the hat on
his head. They shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>"This is a delightful surprise," Tranter said,
turning back to the door. "Come in."</p>

<p>"It is late," Monsieur Dupont apologized&mdash;"but
I entreat a moment. It is three hours
only since I arrived, and I have passed one of
them on your doorstep."</p>

<p>"An hour?" Tranter exclaimed. "But
surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont squeezed himself into the
narrow hall with difficulty.</p>

<p>"I possess the gift of patience," he claimed
modestly. "In London it is of great value."</p>

<p>In the small library he looked about him with
surprise. The plain, almost scanty furniture
of Tranter's house evidently did not accord
with his expectations of the residence of an
English Privy Councillor. Monsieur Dupont
sat down on a well-worn leather couch, and
stared, somewhat blankly, at the rows of dull,
monotonous bindings in the simple mahogany
bookcases.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
He placed the drink Tranter mixed for him
on a small table by his side, accepted a cigar,
and puffed at it serenely. And in that position,
Monsieur Victorien Dupont presented a
pleasing picture of elephantine geniality. He
was so large that his presence seemed to fill
half the room. His great face was one tremendous
smile. His eyes, though capable of
a disconcertingly direct gaze, were clear and
even childlike. His English was perfect, his
evening-dress faultless, and, though obviously
a <i>bon-viveur</i>, he was also unmistakably a man
with a purpose.</p>

<p>"And what has brought you to London?"
Tranter asked, sitting opposite to him.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Monsieur Dupont, "I am
here with a remarkable object. I have come to
use the eyes the good God has given me. And
to do so I beg the assistance of the great position
the good God has given you."</p>

<p>"I hope," Tranter returned, "that what you
require will enable me to make some sort of return
to the man who saved my life."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont waved his hands in a gigantic
gesture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"To restore to the world one of its great
men&mdash;it was a privilege for which I, myself,
should pay! The service I ask of you is
small."</p>

<p>"You have but to name it," said the Privy
Councillor.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Suddenly there was no smile on Monsieur
Dupont's face. Without the smile it was a
very much less pleasant face.</p>

<p>"Two years ago, in my own country," his
voice acquired a new snap, "some one asked
me a riddle."</p>

<p>"A riddle?" Tranter echoed, surprised at the
change.</p>

<p>"A very strange riddle. Unfortunately, I
cannot tell you what it was. I cannot tell any
one what it was. I undertook to find the answer.
From France the riddle took me far
away to another country&mdash;and there, after a
year's work, I found half the answer. The
other half is in London. And I am in London
to find it."</p>

<p>"This is interesting," said Tranter, smiling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
slightly at the huge Frenchman's intense seriousness.</p>

<p>"You, my friend, can help me."</p>

<p>"I am at your service," the other promised.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont half-emptied his glass, and
the smile began to reappear on his face in
gradual creases. In a moment the shadow had
vanished. He laughed like a jolly giant.</p>

<p>"Ah, forgive me! I had almost committed
the crime to be serious. It is a fault that is
easy in your London."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do for you?"
Tranter asked.</p>

<p>"I want," said Monsieur Dupont, "to be
taken with you, as your friend from Paris, to
one or two society functions&mdash;where I may be
likely to meet ... what I seek."</p>

<p>Tranter was somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p>"Unconsciously," he returned&mdash;"though of
course, I will make it my business to fulfill your
wishes&mdash;you have really asked me a difficult
thing. No man goes less into society than I
do. Most people have given up inviting me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," said Monsieur Dupont again.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"I had imagined I should be asking a thing the
most simple."</p>

<p>"So you are," Tranter assured him. "The
fault is with me. Where women are concerned
I am utterly hopeless. I fly from a
pretty woman as you might fly from a crocodile."</p>

<p>"An ugly woman," said Monsieur Dupont,
"is the real friend of man&mdash;if he would but
know it."</p>

<p>"The dull family dinners of dull family people
are the only 'functions' I ever attend.
However, let me see what can be done for you."
Tranter rose, and with an amused expression
began to sort out a small pile of cards on the
mantel-piece.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont smiled on. He emptied
his glass, and inhaled the smoke of his excellent
cigar with all the enjoyment of a satisfied
connoisseur. His glance played from one
article of furniture to another, from the floor
to the ceiling, from bookcase to bookcase, from
picture to picture. The very plainness of the
room seemed to fascinate him. His gaze
sought out the ugliest picture, and became fixed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
on it. Tranter turned over all the cards, and
shrugged his shoulders helplessly.</p>

<p>"In a couple of days I shall be able to fix
you up a dozen times over," he said. "But
I am afraid I have scarcely anything to offer
you for to-morrow night. Why didn't you
drop me a line in advance?"</p>

<p>"Let us dispense with to-morrow night,
then," said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>Tranter ran through the cards again.</p>

<p>"There is a dinner at Lord Crumbleton's&mdash;which
I have too much regard for you to suggest.
The Countess is a most estimable lady,
who has spent the last fifteen years in vain attempts
to become unfaithful to her husband,
and now reads the Apocrypha all day for stimulation.
You could dine with a high-church
clergyman who absolves sins, or an actor-manager
who commits them. But stay&mdash;&mdash;"
he paused quickly. "I forgot. There is
something else." He sorted out a card.
"Here is a possibility of amusement that had
escaped me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"George Copplestone has favored me wit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
an invitation to a select gathering at his house
at Richmond, which would be very much more
likely to provide answers to riddles. I never
accept Copplestone's invitations on principle&mdash;although
he goes on sending them. But, if
you like, I will break my rule, and take you.
It is sure to be entertaining, if nothing more."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont bowed his gratitude.
Tranter replaced the cards, and returned to his
seat.</p>

<p>"Copplestone is a remarkable individual,
who has learnt what a multitude of sins even a
slight financial connection with the Theater
will cover. He puts various sums of money
into the front of the house to gain unquestioned
admission to the back. He has an
extraordinary taste for fantasy, and is always
startling his friends with some new eccentricity.
He is not generally considered to be a
desirable acquaintance&mdash;and certainly no man
in London has less regard for the conventions."</p>

<p>"To confine myself to desirable acquaintances,"
said Monsieur Dupont, "would be my
last wish."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
"Then we will go to Richmond to-morrow
night. He lives in a very strange house, in a
stranger garden&mdash;the sort of place that no
ordinary normal person could possibly live in.
And I warn you that you will find nothing
ordinary or normal in it. If you are interested
in some of the unaccountable vagaries of human
nature, you will enjoy yourself."</p>

<p>"The unaccountable vagaries of human nature,"
said Monsieur Dupont, "are the foundation
of my riddle."</p>

<p>"Then," Tranter returned, "I could give
you no better chance to solve it. In addition,
you will probably make the acquaintance of a
certain pretty society widow, who wants to
marry him because of his vices, and one or two
other well-known people who owe him money
and can't afford to refuse to dine with him.
Also, as the invitation is an unusually pressing
one, we can rely on the introduction of
some unexpected freaks for our entertainment."</p>

<p>"It is arranged," Monsieur Dupont declared,
"I go with you to Richmond."</p>

<p>"Very well," Tranter agreed. "Call for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
me here at eight o'clock, and we will go. Help
yourself to another drink."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont helped himself to another
drink.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Crooked House</span></p>


<p>It was no unusual thing for George Copplestone
to spring surprises on his guests.
He had a twisted sense of the dramatic,
and twisted things were expected from
him. On some occasions he perpetrated the
wildest and most extravagant eccentricities,
without the slightest regard for the moral or
artistic sensibilities of those on whom he imposed
them&mdash;on others he contented himself
with less harrowing minor freaks&mdash;but the object
of thoroughly upsetting and confounding
the mental balances of his victims was invariably
achieved. He delighted, and displayed
remarkable ingenuity, in providing orgies of
the abnormal. He reveled in producing an
atmosphere of brain-storm, and in dealing
sledge-hammer blows at the intellects of his
better balanced acquaintances. Often he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in uncontrollable spirits&mdash;on fire with mental
and physical exuberance&mdash;sometimes he was
morose and silent, and apparently weak. Frequently
he disappeared for considerable periods,
and his house appeared to be closed.
But none saw his coming or going.</p>

<p>Strange rumors circulated about him from
time to time. Certain social circles, to which
his wealth and position entitled him to the
entr&eacute;e, were closed to him. Over and above
his wild extravagancies, he was credited with
vices that remained unnamed. It was said
that things took place in his house that sealed
the lips of men and women. When his name
was mentioned in the clubs, some men
shrugged their shoulders. When it was spoken
in the drawing-rooms, some women remained
silent. There had been an attempt to stab
him, and twice he had been shot at. After
the second attempt, a woman had been heard
to say bitterly that he must bear a charmed
life. He continued to pursue his strange ways
with supreme indifference to the opinions of his

<p>The house he lived in was the only sort of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
house he could have lived in. From the
foundations to the topmost brick it was a mass
of bewildering crookedness. Nothing was
straight. Not a single passage led where it
would have been expected to lead&mdash;not a
staircase fulfilled normal anticipations.
Scarcely two windows in the whole building
were the same size&mdash;scarcely two rooms were
the same shape&mdash;and not even two contortions
corresponded. There must have been a mile
of unnecessary corridors, dozens of incomprehensible
corners and turnings, and at least a
score of unwanted entrances and exits. If
the aim and object of the architect, whoever
he was, had been to reduce the unfortunate
occupants of his handiwork to a condition of
hopeless mental entanglement, he could not
have created a more effective instrument for
the purpose. George Copplestone found it a
residence after his own heart, and delighted
in the means it provided for gratifying his feverish
inspirations.</p>

<p>The room into which John Tranter and
Monsieur Victorien Dupont were ushered at
eight-thirty on the following night presented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
an extraordinary spectacle of lavish and indiscriminate
decoration, arriving at a general
suggestion of something between a Royal visit
and preparations for a wildly enthusiastic
Christmas. Flags and festoons, flowers, real
and imitation, fairy-candles and colored lamps,
burning with strange heavy scents, quaint fantastic
shapes of paper, startlingly illuminated&mdash;all
massed into an indescribable disorder of
light and color. Five amazed people were
awaiting further developments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Astley-Rolfe was a charming widow of
twenty-seven, who had successfully gambled
on her late husband's probable lease of life, and
was now in the throes of a wild attachment to
George Copplestone, to which he had shown
himself by no means averse. She was somewhat
languid from an excess of luxury, unable
to brook opposition even to a whim, and as yet
undefeated in the attainment of her desires,
which were not, perhaps, always to the credit
of her sex. She had an insufficient income,
and a weakness for inscribing her signature on
stamped slips of paper, several of which, it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
rumored, were in Copplestone's possession.
Her house in Grosvenor Gardens was an artistic
paradise, and was frequently visited by
gentlemen from Jermyn Street, who seemed
fond of assuring themselves that its treasures
remained intact.</p>

<p>A West-End clergyman, of Evangelical appearance,
who translated French farces under
a <i>nom-de-plume</i>, was advocating, in confidence,
the abolition of the Censor to a well-known
theatrical manager, whose assets were all in
the name of his wife. A bejeweled Russian
danseuse, who spoke broken English with a
Highland accent, extolled the attractions of
theatrical investment to a Hebrew financier,
who was feasting his eyes on the curves of her
figure, and hoping that she was sufficiently
hard-up. The entrance of Tranter and his
huge companion created general surprise.
Mrs. Astley-Rolfe held up her hands prettily.</p>

<p>"You?" she exclaimed, to Tranter. "You&mdash;of
all people&mdash;condescending to visit our plane?
The mystery is explained at once. The decorations
are for you&mdash;the Pillar of the State!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"Indeed they are not," he assured her. He
stood aside. "Permit me to introduce my
friend, Monsieur Dupont."</p>

<p>"This is delightful!" she smiled.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont bent over her hand.</p>

<p>"Madame," he declared, "I change completely
my opinion of London."</p>

<p>"Where is Copplestone?" Tranter inquired,
gazing with amazement round the festooned
room.</p>

<p>A frown passed over Mrs. Astley-Rolfe's
face.</p>

<p>"He has not yet appeared. He sent in a
message asking us to wait for him here. He
is up to some freak obviously."</p>

<p>"It is certainly a strange medley of color,"
Tranter admitted. "Fortunately, I am not
particularly susceptible&mdash;but to an artistic
temperament I can understand that the effect
would be acute. What extraordinary event
can such a blaze be intended to celebrate?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she returned, a little shortly.
"He has told us nothing."</p>

<p>Her eyes strayed anxiously to the door.
The movements of her hands were nervous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
"I wish he would come," she muttered&mdash;and
stood away from them.</p>

<p>Tranter drew his companion across the
room.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, smiling. "How do you
like this somewhat showy welcome?"</p>

<p>"My friend," said Monsieur Dupont slowly&mdash;"into
what manner of house have you
brought me?"</p>

<p>"Copplestone is a curious fellow," Tranter
replied. "I warned you to be prepared for
something unusual."</p>

<p>"It is a crooked house," said Monsieur Dupont.
"It stands on a crooked road, and there
are crooked paths all round it. And everything
is crooked inside it."</p>

<p>"These decorations are crooked enough, at
any rate," Tranter laughed.</p>

<p>"These decorations," said Monsieur Dupont,
"are not only crooked&mdash;they are bad. Very
bad."</p>

<p>He lowered his voice. There was a gleam
of excitement in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," he whispered, "that decorations
can be good or bad, just as men and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
women can be good or bad? These decorations
are bad. They are a mockery of all decorations&mdash;a
travesty the most heartless of the motives
for which good and pure people decorate.
There is nothing honest or straightforward
about them. They are a mean confusion of all
the symbols of joy. They are put up for some
cruel and detestable purpose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door flew open with a snap, and a young
man of dishevelled appearance burst into the
room. His eyes were wild, and his face was
working with the intensity of his passion.</p>

<p>"Christine," he panted. "Christine...."</p>

<p>He stopped, and gazed round in a dazed
fashion, clenching and unclenching his hands.</p>

<p>Mrs. Astley-Rolfe sprang forward with a
suppressed cry, and confronted him tensely.</p>

<p>"Well?" she cried sharply&mdash;"what about
Christine?"</p>

<p>He did not seem to be aware of her. He was
staring at the flags, the lights, the flowers, and
the colored paper.</p>

<p>"It is true then," he muttered. "These
things...."</p>

<p>The woman was as white as death. Her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
hands were locked together. She swayed.</p>

<p>"What is true?" she gasped.</p>

<p>The young man took no notice of her. Copplestone's
elderly manservant appeared in the
doorway, and approached him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Copplestone declines to see you, sir&mdash;and
requests that you will leave his house. I
have orders, otherwise, to send for the police."</p>

<p>The young man drew himself up. He was
suddenly quite composed and dignified. The
passion died out of his face, leaving an expression
almost of contentment in its place.</p>

<p>"I wish it to be understood," he said, addressing
himself to the room generally with
perfect evenness, "that, rather than allow
Christine Manderson to become engaged to
George Copplestone, I will tear her to pieces
with my own hands, and utterly destroy her."
And he turned, and walked quietly out of the
room.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed all eyes were
fixed on the white, rigid woman. Her face
was drawn and haggard. She seemed to have
grown old and weak. Her whole frame appeared
to have shrunk under an overwhelming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
blow. For some moments she stood motionless.
Then, with a supreme effort of self-control,
she turned, and faced them steadily.</p>

<p>"I think," she said calmly, "that if Miss
Manderson is in the house she should be
warned."</p>

<p>"Fellow was mad," said the theatrical manager.</p>

<p>"<i>Tout-a-fait</i> daft," agreed the Russian danseuse.</p>

<p>"It would have been safer," Tranter remarked,
"if he had been given in charge."</p>

<p>There was something very like contempt in
Mrs. Astley-Rolfe's glance.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said quietly, "that that
young man is a millionaire who lives on a
pound a week, and spends the remaining nine
hundred and ninety-nine pounds a week on
saving lives and souls in places in London that
people like us try to avoid even hearing about?
If it is madness to devote your life and money
to lifting some of the world's shadows&mdash;then
he is very mad."</p>

<p>"Mosth creditable," said the Hebrew financier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
She turned her back on them, and stood
apart.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont laid a hand on Tranter's
arm.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said&mdash;and there was the
faintest tremor in his voice, "I ask you again&mdash;into
what manner of house have you brought
me?"</p>

<p>"I am beginning to wish that I had <i>not</i>
brought you," Tranter returned. "I don't like
the atmosphere."</p>

<p>"That," said Monsieur Dupont, drawing
him aside, "is where we differ. To me the atmosphere
is extremely interesting. If I were
a sportsman, I would make you a bet that this
will be an eventful evening."</p>

<p>"I feel strongly," said Tranter seriously,
"that we should be wise to leave. We don't
want to be mixed up in an affair with a madman."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont shook his head.</p>

<p>"The millionaire was not mad, my friend.
He may have been mad yesterday. He may
be mad to-morrow. But he is very sane to-night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
"I don't like it," Tranter maintained. "I
would much rather go. Events under this
roof have a trick of being a little too dramatic."</p>

<p>Laughter from the clergyman, the financier,
and the danseuse, greeted the conclusion of a
story with which the theatrical manager had
attempted to relieve the strain. Monsieur Dupont
drew Tranter still further back.</p>

<p>"This Mademoiselle Manderson&mdash;do you
know her?"</p>

<p>"No," Tranter replied. "I've never heard
of her. I suppose she is some new friend of
Copplestone's. If she is really engaged to him,
I don't think she is altogether to be envied."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's glance found Mrs. Astley-Rolfe.</p>

<p>"No," he remarked softly&mdash;"I do not think
she is."</p>

<p>Two heavy curtains at the extreme end of
the room were drawn apart, and the figure of
a man appeared between them&mdash;a tall, thick-set
man, in full evening-dress, with a large white
flower in his button-hole. For a moment he
stood still, looking intently down the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
"Copplestone," Tranter whispered to his
companion.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," muttered Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>It was the face of a fanatic&mdash;wonderful,
fascinating, cruel&mdash;a fanatic who neither
feared God nor regarded man&mdash;an infinite
egotist. The fires of a great distorted soul
smoldered in his eyes. The broad, lofty forehead
proclaimed a mind that might have placed
him among the rulers of men&mdash;but instead he
was little above the level of a clown. The
destinies of a nation might have rested in the
hands that he turned only to selfish fantasy.
The whole appearance of him, arresting and
almost awe-inspiring as it undoubtedly was,
had in it the repulsiveness of the unnatural&mdash;and,
with that, all the tragedy of pitiful waste.</p>

<p>To-night, he confronted his guests in an
attitude, and with an air, of triumph. But as
Mrs. Astley-Rolfe turned quickly to him with
something of a challenge in her bearing, a faint
mocking smile appeared and lingered for a
moment on his face. Then he moved aside,
his hand on the curtains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said deliberately,
"permit me to present you to my fianc&eacute;e&mdash;Miss
Christine Manderson."</p>

<p>He drew the curtains apart.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," said Monsieur Dupont again.</p>

<p>A half-strangled sob came from the lips of
Mrs. Astley-Rolfe. Tranter uttered an exclamation.
The danseuse, the clergyman, and
the theatrical manager burst into vigorous applause.</p>

<p>Framed in the darkness behind him was the
white form of a woman, of transcendent loveliness.
In the soft light it seemed almost a
celestial figure. She smiled with entrancing
sweetness, and held out her hands.</p>

<p>But as her gaze swept over the occupants of
the room, the smile vanished. Her eyes became
fixed and staring; her face set. She uttered
a sharp cry&mdash;and fell forward in a dead
faint.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Endless Garden</span></p>


<p>Confusion followed. Copplestone
knelt beside her, calling her by name
in a strange excess of fear. The
theatrical manager tore a flask from
his pocket, and administered its contents freely.
The spirit revived her. She opened her eyes.
They lifted her gently, and laid her on a couch.</p>

<p>"It was that madman rushing in unnerved
her," Copplestone cried fiercely. "Wish I'd
called in the police. Curse him!"</p>

<p>Her hand closed on his. "No, no," she
whispered. "He must not be touched. He
didn't mean it."</p>

<p>"Mean it be damned!" said Copplestone
savagely. "If I see any more of him, he'll
find himself in jail in less time than it takes to
say it."</p>

<p>The manager proffered further stimulant.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
The color began to return to her face, but her
eyes were wide and strained. Copplestone
watched her closely.</p>

<p>"Look here," said the manager, re-corking
his empty flask, "she'd better rest. Let's all
clear off, and go on with this another night."</p>

<p>"Thertainly," agreed the financier.</p>

<p>But Christine Manderson rose, and leant on
Copplestone's arm. Her self-control was exerted
to the utmost, but she trembled.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," she said softly. "I am all
right now. Please don't go."</p>

<p>"Good!" Copplestone exclaimed, recovering
his equanimity. "It would be a pity to break
up. We'll have a jolly night." He laughed
loudly. "Tranter, of all people!" he cried
boisterously. "And&mdash;&mdash;" he looked towards
Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"I was sure you wouldn't mind my bringing
a friend with me," Tranter said. "Monsieur
Dupont has just arrived from Paris."</p>

<p>"Delighted," said Copplestone, shaking
hands with great heartiness. "Forgive this
unhappy beginning. We'll make up for it now.
Come along to dinner. It's all ready."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
In the dining-room they sat down to a table
that glittered and gleamed with a hundred
lights, concealed under strands of white crystallized
leaves, springing from a frosted tree.
Such a table might have been set in Fairyland,
for the betrothal feast of Oberon.</p>

<p>"Glad we didn't miss this," said the theatrical
manager.</p>

<p>He regaled the company with a selection of
his less offensive stories, and found ready applause.
The gayety was loud and forced.
Every one attempted to keep it at fever-heat.
Jest followed jest with increasing rapidity.
Laughter rang out on the smallest provocation.
It was a competition in hilarity. And
the gayest of all were Christine Manderson,
and Mrs. Astley-Rolfe.</p>

<p>The night was hot and sultry. The distant
roll of thunder added to the tenseness of the
atmosphere. And hearing it, Christine Manderson
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Storms are unlucky to me," she said, listening
until the sullen roll died away. "Why
should we have one to-night&mdash;of all nights?"</p>

<p>The clergyman adroitly twisted the subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of lightning into a compliment. As the dinner
drew to a somewhat loud conclusion, Copplestone's
face grew flushed, and his hands unsteady.
The manager's voice and stories
thickened, and the thoughts of the Russian
danseuse became fixed on Aberdeen. Tranter
and Monsieur Dupont were abstemious guests.
But the Frenchman seemed to be enjoying himself
immensely.</p>

<p>They rose from the fairy table, and strolled
out through the open windows into the garden.
The air had grown hotter and more oppressive,
the thunder louder. Frequent flashes lit up
the darkness.</p>

<p>The glowing tips of cigars and cigarettes
disappeared in various directions across the
lawns.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Monsieur Dupont discovered, to his cost, the
truth of his remark that the house was surrounded
by crooked paths. The grounds were
a veritable maze. He had purposely slipped
away alone, and in five minutes was involved
in a network of twisting, thickly-hedged paths,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
all of which seemed only to lead still further
into the darkness.</p>

<p>He stopped, and listened. He could hear
no voices. Not a sound, except the gathering
thunder, disturbed the silence. He was completely
cut off. Even the lights of the house
were hidden from him. He had turned about
so many times that he did not even know in
which direction it lay. Coupled with the effect
of what had happened in the house, the influence
of this tortuous garden was sinister and
unnerving. In the lightning flashes, now more
vivid and frequent, he tried in vain to determine
his position. He wandered about, trying
path after path, doubling back on his own
tracks&mdash;only to find himself more and more
helplessly lost.</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de Dieu</i>," said Monsieur Dupont, in
despair.</p>

<p>He halted suddenly, standing as still as a
figure of stone. On his right the hedge was
thick and high. He could see nothing. But
the whisper of a voice had reached him.</p>

<p>The path took a sharp turn. He stepped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
noiselessly on to the grass border, and crept
round, with wonderful agility for a man of his
size. The foliage gradually thinned, and
kneeling down he was able to listen and peer
through until the next flash should reveal what
lay beyond.</p>

<p>The whisper thrilled with indescribable passion.</p>

<p>"I love you. You are my body, my soul,
my god, my all. I love you&mdash;I love you&mdash;I
love you."</p>

<p>It was the voice of Christine Manderson.</p>

<p>Not a tremor escaped the listener. Parting
the leaves with a hand as steady as the ground
itself, he waited for the light.</p>

<p>"I have no world but you&mdash;no thought but
you. I want nothing but you ... you ...
you." A sob broke her voice.</p>

<p>"Go," the answer was almost inaudible in
its tenseness. "Go&mdash;and forget. I have nothing
for you."</p>

<p>The lightning came. In a small open space
on the other side of the hedge it illuminated
the wild tortured face of Christine Manderson.
And standing before her, gripping both her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
hands and holding her away from him&mdash;John
Tranter.</p>

<p>She struggled to bring herself closer to him.</p>

<p>"I thought you were dead," she gasped.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> dead," he answered. "I am dead to
you. Let me go."</p>

<p>The listener could almost hear the effort of
her breathing.</p>

<p>"I waited for you," she panted. "I was
broken. I had to seem happy&mdash;but my heart
was a tomb. You were all my life&mdash;all my
hope. I know I wasn't what I might have
been. I was what people call an adventuress.
But my love for you was the one great, true
thing of my life. Oh, why did you leave
me?"</p>

<p>"For your own sake," he said slowly. "I
am no mate for such a woman as you."</p>

<p>"My own sake?" she repeated. "My own
sake&mdash;to take from me the only thing I had&mdash;my
only chance?&mdash;to throw my life into the
shadows? My own sake ... to have made
me what I am?"</p>

<p>"I would have spared you this meeting," he
returned, "if I had known. But the name
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Christine Manderson was strange to me. I
had never heard it before."</p>

<p>"I changed my name," she said sadly. "I
couldn't bear that any one should use the name
that you had used. I called myself Christine
Manderson, and went on the stage in New
York. Oh, it was dreadful. All those long
years since you left me I have lived under a
mask&mdash;as you have seen me to-night. You
thought I was smiling&mdash;but I didn't smile.
You thought I was laughing&mdash;but I didn't
laugh. It was all ... only disguised tears
... to hide myself."</p>

<p>"Go," his voice was torn. "For God's sake
go ... Thea."</p>

<p>A second flash showed them again to the
listener. Tranter was still holding her away
from him. In that vivid fraction of a second
the agony of her face was terrible.</p>

<p>"Thea!" she echoed pitifully. "Ah, yes&mdash;call
me Thea! Poor Thea! Oh, doesn't
that name awaken ... something? Hasn't
it still some charm? Once you said it was the
only name in all the world. Is it nothing to
you now?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
"Nothing," he answered.</p>

<p>In spite of his resistance she was forcing
herself nearer to him. The magic of her presence
was binding him.</p>

<p>"Am I less beautiful?" she whispered.
"Have I lost anything that used to draw you?
Is not my hair as golden? Are not my eyes
as bright&mdash;my lips as red? Am I not as soft
to touch? Where could you find anything better
than me?"</p>

<p>"Keep back!" he muttered.</p>

<p>Her hands were about him. In the darkness
he could feel the deadly loveliness of her face
almost touching his own. He was yielding,
inch by inch. The warmth of her breath ...
the perfume of her body.... Her closeness
was intoxicating&mdash;maddening.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me come to you," she prayed. "I
will follow you barefooted to the end of the
world. I will live for you&mdash;slave for you&mdash;die
for you. Only let me come. Let me leave
all this&mdash;and come to you ... to-morrow...."</p>

<p>A groan was wrung from him. He crushed
her to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
"Come then!" he cried desperately. "Come,
if you will!..."</p>

<p>A vivid flash, which seemed to burst almost
over their heads, showed them locked in each
other's arms, their lips pressed together.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont raised himself quickly.
There was the sound of running footsteps on
the path behind him. Monsieur Dupont had
just time to turn the corner before the disordered
figure of the theatrical manager loomed
up before him.</p>

<p>"The madman is in the garden! He ran
this way."</p>

<p>"<i>Diable!</i>" said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"I found him sneaking towards the house.
He bolted out here."</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to physical exertion, the
manager laid a heavy hand on Monsieur Dupont's
shoulder, and mopped his forehead
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The scoundrel means mischief," he declared.
"He must be found."</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"I called him, but couldn't get an answer.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
He must be away at the other end of the garden."</p>

<p>"No one has passed this way," Monsieur
Dupont assured him. "For a half-hour I have
been wandering about these horrible paths."</p>

<p>"It's a devil of a garden," the manager admitted.
"The fellow won't get very far.
Let's look about here."</p>

<p>Fortified with a fresh supply of breath, he
released Monsieur Dupont's shoulder, and
made a brisk movement towards the direction
from which the Frenchman had come.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont blocked the way.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;it would be a waste of time. I
have come from there."</p>

<p>"To the river, then," the manager cried,
bearing him round. "He may be trying to get
across."</p>

<p>He was evidently familiar with the intricacies
of the garden. In a few minutes, after a
dozen turnings, they reached the gleam of
water.</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open for the next flash,"
the manager directed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
He peered about. A moment later the
lightning lit up the calm stretch of the river
and the broad lawns sloping down to it. Monsieur
Dupont detected no form or movement&mdash;but
with a startling shout, the manager
bounded away from him across the lawns.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont blinked after him in astonishment.</p>

<p>He was alone again&mdash;in a new and even
darker part of the endless garden.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Destruction</span></p>


<p>A deep-toned clock in the house
struck twelve.</p>

<p>Rain began to fall. A few moments
later the financier hurried
across the lawns with his collar turned up.
The danseuse followed him. She seemed a
disappointed and indignant woman.</p>

<p>"It's almost an insult," she complained overtaking
him.</p>

<p>"Noth a penny more," said the financier
firmly.</p>

<p>They both turned quickly. Her hand
gripped his arm convulsively. Wild shouting
arose in the darkness, and the sound of someone
forcing a headlong way through hedge and
bush.</p>

<p>The Reverend Percival Delamere was rushing
towards the house as if the entire penalties
of sin were at his heels.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
"A corpse! A corpse by the river! Miss
Manderson has been murdered!"</p>

<p>The danseuse uttered a terrified cry. The
financier shook.</p>

<p>"Murderedth?" he gasped, shrinking back.</p>

<p>The clergyman was shattered by horror.</p>

<p>"By the river ... almost torn to pieces...."</p>

<p>The danseuse screamed loudly. A figure
bounded up behind them, and a hand seized
the clergyman's throat in a savage grip. The
furious, distorted face of George Copplestone
glared down at him. He struggled, freeing
himself with all his strength.</p>

<p>"Copplestone," he choked, "something dreadful
has happened to Miss Manderson. I found
her by the river ... horribly torn...."</p>

<p>From another direction, Tranter reached
them, breathless.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? What has happened?"</p>

<p>The financier clung to him.</p>

<p>"Mith Manderthon ... murderedth."</p>

<p>Tranter shook him off, and stood very still.
The agony on his face passed unnoticed. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the theatrical manager and Mrs. Astley-Rolfe
arrived at a run, Copplestone, with a sound like
the cry of a raging animal, grasped the unhappy
clergyman by the arm, and dashed off
towards the river.</p>

<p>The others followed. They found her lying
a few yards from the water's edge. The
manager struck a match, and they looked
down.</p>

<p>The danseuse shrieked, and fainted. Mrs.
Astley-Rolfe sank on her knees, sobbing, and
covered her face with her hands. The financier
sickened, and turned away, trembling
violently.</p>

<p>"God!" Tranter cried&mdash;"some one must have
stamped on her!"</p>

<p>He bent down. "Thea...." he whispered.</p>

<p>Something like a sob shook him. But the
others did not see.</p>

<p>"It must have been a wild beast," shuddered
the clergyman.</p>

<p>"It is the work of a madman," said the manager
hoarsely. "He has utterly destroyed her&mdash;as
he threatened."</p>

<p>George Copplestone stood without a tremor.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
As he looked down at the broken form all his
frenzy disappeared. The distortion of his first
fury faded from his face, leaving it set in a
pallid, lifeless mask. He contemplated the
dreadful destruction at his feet without a sign
of horror, or even of pity. He was perfectly
steady. Not a quiver escaped him. Stooping
down, he asked quietly for assistance to carry
the body to the house.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said the manager, looking at
him curiously. "She ought not to be moved
before the police come."</p>

<p>Copplestone straightened himself, and remained
silent.</p>

<p>"Let Gluckstein take the women in, and telephone
to the Police Station," the manager suggested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Astley-Rolfe raised her bloodless face.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she sobbed. "Let me go. It's
too horrible. I can't bear it."</p>

<p>Tranter raised her up. The danseuse had
recovered consciousness, and was crying hysterically.
Suddenly the financier startled
them in a thin high voice, pointing a shaking
finger into the darkness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
"Someone ith moving! Out there behind
uth! Whoth there? Whoth there?"</p>

<p>They swung round, straining their eyes into
the blackness.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" the manager called.</p>

<p>An answering voice reached them. The
manager struck another match. On the edge
of the darkness they saw an enormous figure.</p>

<p>"It's Monsieur Dupont!" Tranter cried.</p>

<p>"My friends," exclaimed Monsieur Dupont,
"at last I find you! What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Copplestone looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"The matter," he said evenly, "is that Miss
Manderson has been murdered."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont uttered an extraordinary
exclamation. He was instantly galvanized
into a condition of seething energy. With
what was almost a snarl, he brushed the
financier aside, and reached the white mangled
form on the ground.</p>

<p>For a tense minute he knelt beside it. The
others waited.</p>

<p>"Destroyed," they heard him mutter&mdash;"utterly
destroyed...."</p>

<p>When he rose, his eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
"It is terrible. Who was with her last?"</p>

<p>"I was with her less than a quarter of an
hour ago," Tranter replied. "She said she
was going back to the house, and asked me to
find Mr. Copplestone, and tell him that she was
not feeling well."</p>

<p>"Where are your police?" asked Monsieur
Dupont.</p>

<p>"Gluckstein is going to take the ladies back
to the house, and telephone for them," the manager
returned.</p>

<p>The financier departed with his charges.
The four men remained, facing each other over
the dead body. Rain was falling heavily.</p>

<p>"Poor girl," said the clergyman huskily.</p>

<p>"That such a brute should be at large," the
manager added.</p>

<p>Copplestone's gaze again became rivetted to
the ground. He seemed unconscious of their
presence. He was like a man alone and dazed
in a strange world.</p>

<p>Then the storm burst over them with all its
fury. The rain poured down in torrents, the
lightning was incessant. It was as if the
elements themselves, in their rage, were seeking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to complete the work of destruction.</p>

<p>"We can't leave her out in this&mdash;police or
no police," the clergyman shivered.</p>

<p>Copplestone bent down again. The manager
moved to assist, but Tranter put him aside,
and assisted Copplestone to lift the ghastly
burden in his arms. Then they picked their
way slowly along the winding paths to the
house.</p>

<p>When they entered the decorated room,
Copplestone's strange immobility flashed upon
him with startling suddenness. Uttering a
oath, he placed what he had previously
been carrying with dull indifference roughly
on a couch, and hurled himself furiously
upon the confusion of decorations, tearing
and crushing everything into a smashed
heap on the floor. So overwhelming was his
violence that no one dared attempt to stop
him. He dashed the lights to the ground, and
rent the flags with appalling ferocity. In a
few moments a shattered pile was all that remained
of the medley of illumination. He
stood on the pile and ground his heels into it.</p>

<p>Then all the energy was snuffed out of him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
like the switching off of an electric current.
The dull heavy cloud descended on him again.
He stared vacantly at the others, shrugged his
shoulders slightly, and turned his back on
them.</p>

<p>The silence remained unbroken until a loud
ringing at the front door bell announced the
arrival of the police.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Copplestone</span></p>


<p>Detective-Inspector Fay
was an able and successful officer,
of international reputation, whose
achievements had placed a substantial
price on his head in most countries sufficiently
civilized to possess their criminal organizations.
His bag had included many famous
law-breakers, and, though now employed in
less strenuous directions, he was admitted to be
one of the most skilful and reliable of Scotland
Yard's unravelers of mystery. But, experienced
as he was, the inspector could not suppress
his horror and indignation when the
mutilated body of Christine Manderson was
uncovered to him.</p>

<p>"What, in God's name, was there in this
garden to-night?" he demanded, shuddering.</p>

<p>"A madman," the theatrical manager muttered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
The inspector's glance rested on him for
an instant, but passed on. He made no further
remarks during his examination&mdash;but when,
concluding it, he carefully replaced the covering
and turned again to the others, there was
a concentrated gleam in his eyes and a certain
set to his face that were known to bode ill
to the perpetrators of the deeds that inspired
them.</p>

<p>"There can scarcely be a whole bone in her
body," he declared, regarding them all intently.
"Her face is smashed to pulp; some of the
hair has been wrenched from her head; and
even the bones of her fingers are broken. It is
the most brutal and disgusting crime I have
had the misfortune to meet with in the whole
of my thirty years experience."</p>

<p>He gave a brief order to an attendant constable,
who moved to the door.</p>

<p>"If you will kindly retire with the constable
to the next room," he requested, "I will take
a separate account from every one. Perhaps
Mr. Copplestone will give me his information
first."</p>

<p>The constable marshalled them into an adjoining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
room, which the danseuse filled with
complaints at this prolonged detention. Copplestone
remained behind. His dullness and
immobility had increased almost to a stupor.</p>

<p>"She was engaged to marry me," he said,
in a slow lifeless tone, "since yesterday."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay seated himself at a table, and
opened his note-book.</p>

<p>"We fully sympathize with you, Mr. Copplestone,"
he said quietly, "and I am afraid
it is poor consolation to promise you that
justice shall be done on the inhuman criminal,
whoever it may be."</p>

<p>"Justice?" Copplestone returned, in the same
weary, monotonous voice. "Of what use is
Justice? Can it call her back&mdash;or mend her
broken body?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it cannot," the inspector
admitted. "But it is all humanity can do.
Will you answer a few questions, as clearly
and briefly as possible? The great thing in a
case like this is to lose no time at the beginning."</p>

<p>Copplestone sat down, and passed an unsteady
hand across his forehead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
"Go on," he said dully.</p>

<p>"Where and when did you first meet Miss
Manderson?"</p>

<p>"She came over from New York two months
ago, to play in a new piece at the Imperial.
I have an interest in the theater, and saw her
there for the first time about a week after her
arrival."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of her life and associations
in America?"</p>

<p>"Very little. She was not communicative.
She only told me a few of her theatrical experiences."</p>

<p>"So far as you know," the inspector proceeded,
"had she an enemy in this country&mdash;or
was there any one who could have wished
to harm her?"</p>

<p>"Apparently there was," Copplestone returned.
"I did not know it until to-night."</p>

<p>Mechanically, in the manner of one repeating
a lesson, he described the visit of the young
millionaire, and his threat against Christine
Manderson.</p>

<p>"And the name of this young man?" the
inspector asked, bending over his note-book.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
"James Layton."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay looked up sharply.</p>

<p>"Layton? The man they call the Mad
Philanthropist?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Copplestone replied wearily.
"He may be."</p>

<p>"James Layton is very well known to us,"
the inspector said slowly. "He is a charitable
fanatic, who does more good in the East End
than all the Royally Patronized Associations
put together. But how in the world did he
come to know Miss Manderson?"</p>

<p>"She never mentioned him to me," Copplestone
stated. "I had not heard of him until
he burst into this house to-night."</p>

<p>The inspector made several notes.</p>

<p>"He has educated and trained as his assistant
a particularly wild specimen of a coster
girl, who is madly in love with him...."
He closed his note-book with a snap. "You
say the words he used were that rather
than allow Miss Manderson to become engaged
to you, he would tear her to pieces with his
own hands, and utterly destroy her?"</p>

<p>"So they told me," Copplestone answered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
heavily. "I was not in the room. I refused
to see him."</p>

<p>"And he left quite quietly?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did Miss Manderson show any particular
fear of the threat?"</p>

<p>"She was very much upset, and fainted when
she came into the room. I should have sent
for the police at once, but she begged me not to,
and insisted that he didn't mean what he said.
I wish to God I hadn't listened."</p>

<p>"So there was no doubt that she knew
him?"</p>

<p>"No. She certainly knew him."</p>

<p>"Afterwards, you say, he was seen in the
garden when you were all out after dinner?"
the inspector continued.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who saw him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bolsover, the theatrical manager,
found him sneaking about the house, and
chased him out in the direction of the crime."</p>

<p>"Did any one see him, besides Mr. Bolsover?"</p>

<p>"Apparently not. He says he called to me&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
I had gone into the house to fill my cigarette-case,
and did not hear him."</p>

<p>"He escaped from Mr. Bolsover, and was not
seen again?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was there any one else," the inspector asked
slowly, "who might, for any reason, have entertained
unfriendly feelings towards Miss
Manderson?"</p>

<p>Copplestone's glance sharpened a little under
the question.</p>

<p>"I suppose there was," he admitted, with
some reluctance.</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>Copplestone paused, frowning.</p>

<p>"Please do not hesitate," the inspector
pressed firmly. "We must know everything."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," the tired voice confessed, "it
wasn't altogether playing the game to announce
my engagement so unexpectedly to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" the inspector insisted&mdash;"to whom?"</p>

<p>"To Phyllis Astley-Rolfe."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. The
inspector waited quietly. With an effort,
Copplestone continued.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"I am afraid it was rather cruel. She'd
annoyed me lately, and I put up some decorations,
and announced the news in a dramatic
way ... to mock her." He broke off, staring
at the remains of the decorations on the
floor. "But I tore them down. I shall never
decorate again...."</p>

<p>The inspector watched him closely. He
seemed to be on the verge of sleep.</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Astley-Rolfe had reason to be
jealous of Miss Manderson?" the inspector
demanded briskly.</p>

<p>"I suppose ... she had."</p>

<p>"Good reason?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Had you given her definite cause to believe
that you intended to ask her to marry you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. At any rate ... I had not
given her definite cause to believe that I didn't."</p>

<p>His voice sank to a whisper. He leant back
limply in his chair.</p>

<p>"There is only one more question I need
trouble you with at present," the inspector said.
"Who was the last person to be with Miss Manderson
before the crime was discovered?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Copplestone scarcely opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tranter was with her near the river.
She left him to go back to the house, and asked
him to find me, and tell me she was not
well."</p>

<p>"Did he find you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I at once went into the house."</p>

<p>"Where were you when Mr. Tranter found
you?"</p>

<p>"I was crossing the second lawn&mdash;towards
the tennis courts."</p>

<p>The inspector was busy with his note-book.</p>

<p>"Were you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I had just come out of the house
after filling my cigarette-case, as I told you.
I was looking for Miss Manderson, and wondering
where she had got to. If only I had
gone in the right direction ... I might have
been in time...."</p>

<p>"After Mr. Tranter had spoken to you, you
say you went into the house at once?"</p>

<p>"At once. I waited nearly ten minutes for
her, and came out again just as Mr. Delamere
gave the alarm. I'm afraid I handled him
roughly...."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
The words trailed off into silence. A convulsive
shudder passed through him.</p>

<p>"Then we all ran off ... to where she
lay," his voice shook. "Something seemed to
give way ... here...." he pressed his
hands to his head. "Is there ... anything
more ... you want to know?"</p>

<p>The inspector rose.</p>

<p>"Only one thing. Will you kindly give me
the names of your guests in the other room?"</p>

<p>Copplestone complied slowly. Inspector Fay
wrote the names down.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, laying down his book.
"I am sorry to have had to give you the pain
of answering so many questions. I am afraid
you are quite overwrought. I should advise
you to try to get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Sleep," Copplestone murmured, rising
weakly from his chair. "Sleep.... Good
God."</p>

<p>The inspector himself made a gesture of
fatigue.</p>

<p>"I only got back from another heavy case
as your message came in," he apologized,
stifling a yawn. "Tobacco is the only thing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that keeps me going. Could you give me a
cigarette?"</p>

<p>Without answering, Copplestone languidly
produced an elaborately jeweled gold cigarette-case,
and handed it to the inspector.</p>

<p>There were two cigarettes in it.</p>

<p>Inspector Fay took one, with a perfectly impassive
countenance, and returned the case.
Copplestone replaced it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Please give whatever instructions you like
to my man," he said dully&mdash;"and let me know
if you want me. I shall be in my room."</p>

<p>He turned, and moved away with slow heavy
steps, disappearing between the same curtains
through which, a few hours before, he had
presented Christine Manderson to his guests.</p>

<p>The inspector stood looking after him, fingering
the cigarette thoughtfully, a very curious
expression on his face. He showed no further
signs of fatigue.</p>

<p>"I wonder why you lied to me," he muttered&mdash;and
laid the cigarette on the table.</p>

<p>He glanced down the list of names, and went
to the door. The constable had mounted guard
over his prisoners with extraordinary dignity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
The voice of the danseuse was still raised in
lamentation.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Dupont," the inspector called.</p>

<p>The constable passed on the summons&mdash;and
Monsieur Dupont instantly obeyed it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Trail Of Corpses</span></p>


<p>The inspector closed the door behind
him. "What has brought you back
into the arena?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"A riddle," the Frenchman answered,
in an equally low tone.</p>

<p>"It must have been something pretty big to
have tempted <i>you</i>," the inspector remarked,
coming closer to him.</p>

<p>"It was," Monsieur Dupont admitted.</p>

<p>The other glanced cautiously towards the
curtains at the far end of the room.</p>

<p>"Why are you here&mdash;in this house?" he demanded
softly.</p>

<p>"By chance," Monsieur Dupont replied.</p>

<p>"Did you know Copplestone before?"</p>

<p>"I did not. I had never seen him. I came
with my friend, Tranter."</p>

<p>"You were here all the evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"Anything to tell me?" the inspector asked,
looking at him intently.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont smiled.</p>

<p>"Only, my friend, that I imagine you will
find it an interesting and somewhat unusual
case."</p>

<p>"That's not enough&mdash;from you," the inspector
retorted.</p>

<p>"If I may be permitted to advise&mdash;it is a
case in which you would do well to ignore the
obvious."</p>

<p>"I want more than that," insisted the inspector.</p>

<p>The huge Frenchman remained silent.</p>

<p>"You are not a man to waste your time on
this kind of entertainment," said the inspector
slowly. "Is there any connection between the
crime to-night, and your so-called 'riddle'?"</p>

<p>"The connection of death," said Monsieur
Dupont.</p>

<p>There was something of awe in his voice and
manner.</p>

<p>"For two years," he said, "I have been following
in the track of something, which, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the words of our great Dumas&mdash;'must have
passed this way, for I see a corpse.'"</p>

<p>"That quotation referred to a woman," said
the inspector quickly.</p>

<p>"From me," returned Monsieur Dupont
evenly, "it is sexless&mdash;at present."</p>

<p>The inspector frowned.</p>

<p>"Come," he said impatiently&mdash;"in what way
are you mixed up in this?"</p>

<p>"In the way of my quotation&mdash;a corpse. I
started my quest two years ago&mdash;over a dead
body, torn and mutilated. At the end of the
first year I found another dead body, torn and
mutilated. I follow on and on&mdash;from one
point to the next point&mdash;often with no more
than the instinct of the hunter to guide me.
And here, at the end of the second year, there
is yet another dead body, torn and mutilated.
It is horrible. I sicken. I wish I had remained
in my retirement."</p>

<p>"What were the two previous crimes?" the
inspector asked.</p>

<p>"Two women&mdash;two very beautiful women."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay started, staring at him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
"Miss Manderson was a beautiful woman,"
he said slowly.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's enormous head nodded
several times.</p>

<p>"She was," he agreed deliberately. "The
most beautiful of the three."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then the
inspector laid a hand on the Frenchman's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"We have worked together a good many
times in the past," he said, with more cordiality
than before.</p>

<p>"We have, indeed," Monsieur Dupont responded
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"And though your methods were always
fanciful compared with our's, I know enough
of your powers to ask you a simple, straight
question."</p>

<p>"I am at your service," said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"You were here on the spot when this crime
was committed. Who, or what, smashed the
body of that unfortunate woman to pulp in
this garden to-night?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's gigantic form seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
acquire a new, strange dignity&mdash;a solemnity&mdash;as
though he were in the presence, or speaking,
of something before which humanity must bow
its head.</p>

<p>"A Destroyer," he whispered. "A Destroyer
who strikes with neither fear nor compunction&mdash;and
passes on without pity or remorse.
A Destroyer who is as old as the sins
of men, and as young as the futures of their
children."</p>

<p>"You always spoke in parables," the inspector
exclaimed irritably. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said Monsieur Dupont, "that I
believe the thing which passed through this
crooked garden to-night, leaving death so
horribly behind it, is the same thing that has
already passed on twice before me, and left
the same death in its wake. I cannot tell you
any more. Let us both go our own ways, as
we have done so many times before. I do not
wish to take any credit in this affair. If I am
able to prove its connection with my own case,
and to solve it, I shall hand the whole matter
over to you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The inspector appeared somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's eyes were fixed on an unframed
photograph of Christine Manderson,
which stood on a small cabinet in front of him.</p>

<p>"Please compound a felony," he said softly&mdash;and
slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Where are you to be found?" the inspector
asked.</p>

<p>"At the Hotel Savoy." He yawned. "I
am very sleepy," he complained. "If you will
finish with Mr. Tranter as soon as possible, he
will take me back in his car."</p>

<p>He turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Stay," said the inspector.</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>"You have not lost your old fantastic kink,"
said the inspector, with a faint smile. "The
last time we ran together you were five minutes
ahead of me at the finish. This time&mdash;we will
see who is the first to pass the post."</p>

<p>"My friend," said Monsieur Dupont, "I will
do my best to give you a good race."</p>

<p>He passed out of the room. The inspector
followed him to the door, and called for Mr.
Tranter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tranter," said the inspector,
"I understand that you
were the last person to see Miss
Manderson alive."</p>

<p>"I believe I was," Tranter replied.</p>

<p>The inspector sat down again at the table,
and re-opened his note-book.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell me exactly what happened
from the time you went out into the
garden after dinner, and the time you left Miss
Manderson?"</p>

<p>"We strolled away from the house together,
in the direction of the river. The events of
the evening seemed to have upset her very
much, and she was nervous of the storm. We
walked about, I should think, for nearly half
an hour, until the lightning became very
vivid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see or hear any one in that part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of the garden?" the inspector interrupted.</p>

<p>"No. Most of the others went to the lawns,
in the opposite direction. When the lightning
became very vivid, Miss Manderson said she
would return to the house, and asked me to
go down to the lawns to find Mr. Copplestone,
and send him in to her. She was obviously
unwell."</p>

<p>"You will be able to show me the place
where you left her?"</p>

<p>"I think so. It was very dark&mdash;but I remember
that we had just passed under a number
of rose-arches across the path."</p>

<p>"It was, I presume, further away from the
house than the spot where the body was
found?"</p>

<p>"The body was found close to the river,
about half-way between the house and the place
where I left her," Tranter replied.</p>

<p>"So we may surmise that she had got about
half-way to the house before the attack was
made. How far would that actually be?"</p>

<p>"Along those winding paths," Tranter calculated,
"I should say roughly about a hundred
and fifty yards."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
"Did she start to walk to the house immediately
you left her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She started in that direction as I
started in the other."</p>

<p>"Then," mused the inspector, "she must have
met the criminal, whoever it was, at the most
within three minutes of leaving you?"</p>

<p>"Presumably she must," Tranter agreed.</p>

<p>"And was that," pursued the inspector,
"about the spot where she might have met the
young man, Layton, who was, it appears, being
chased out towards the river by Mr. Bolsover?"</p>

<p>"It might be. But I do not know anything
about the chase. If I had known that Layton
was in the garden, I should not have left her."</p>

<p>"Where did you find Mr. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"On the lawns."</p>

<p>"How long after you parted from her?"</p>

<p>"Only a few minutes. Four or five."</p>

<p>"Was he alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He was looking for Miss Manderson
himself. He went into the house at once."</p>

<p>Silence followed while the inspector added
to his notes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tranter," he said quietly&mdash;and his eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
rested for a moment on the cigarette on the
table, "I have only one suggestion to make.
You will understand that it is only a suggestion,
but I want to be perfectly clear. Considering
that this was the evening of Miss
Manderson's engagement to Mr. Copplestone,
might she not have been expected to have
strolled away from the house, and to have spent
that following half-hour, with him rather than
with you?"</p>

<p>Tranter hesitated.</p>

<p>"I suppose she might," he admitted.</p>

<p>The inspector was looking at him sharply.</p>

<p>"It is a small point," he said smoothly.
"Perhaps you can clear it up."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Tranter was
plainly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Inspector," he said at last, "I must, of
course, tell you everything&mdash;but I should be
obliged if for obvious reasons, you will keep as
much as possible to yourself."</p>

<p>"That, sir," returned the inspector firmly,
"you must leave to my discretion."</p>

<p>"I am content to do so," Tranter said. "The
truth is&mdash;I had met Miss Manderson before."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
"Ah!" said the inspector softly.</p>

<p>"I knew her first nearly six years ago, in
Chicago. Her real name was not Christine
Manderson."</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes began to brighten. He
turned to a fresh page in his note-book.</p>

<p>"She took that name, she told me to-night,
when she went on the stage in New York.
She was really Thea Colville."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay started.</p>

<p>"Thea Colville? The Chicago adventuress?"</p>

<p>"I believe some people called her that,"
Tranter returned shortly.</p>

<p>"The woman who ruined Michael Cranbourne,
son of Joshua Cranbourne, the Nitrate
King?"</p>

<p>"She had finished with Cranbourne before
I knew her," Tranter replied. "He was a
scoundrel. Whatever happened, she certainly
could not be blamed."</p>

<p>The inspector was making rapid notes.</p>

<p>"She was not so wild as she was painted,"
Tranter continued. "Women with such beauty
as hers have a thousand temptations. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
sins of a beautiful woman are always many
degrees blacker than the sins of a plain one.
We became very intimate&mdash;and I am afraid I
allowed her to expect more from me than I
actually intended. I was called back to
England unexpectedly, and heard nothing
more of her until Mr. Copplestone brought her
into this room to-night."</p>

<p>He stopped. Emotion had crept into his
voice.</p>

<p>"During the most part of your conversation
with her, were you walking about, or standing
still?"</p>

<p>"Standing still."</p>

<p>"You have said that you did not hear any
one moving about near you while you were
speaking to her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Were there trees or hedges about, where
some one might have hidden to overhear you?"</p>

<p>"There was a hedge," Tranter replied.
"But I did not notice the spot particularly."</p>

<p>"You will be able to point it out to me to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"I think so. As I say, I did not particularly
notice it&mdash;and the possibility of being overheard
certainly did not occur to me. I am
afraid at that moment caution was hardly a
consideration with either of us."</p>

<p>The inspector closed his note-book.</p>

<p>"Unless circumstances compel me to do
otherwise," he promised, "I will keep your story
to myself. Will you tell me whether the announcement
of Mr. Copplestone's engagement
to Miss Manderson produced a noticeable effect
on any particular person in the room? Please
do not hesitate to answer."</p>

<p>"It certainly appeared to be unwelcome news
to Mrs. Astley-Rolfe," Tranter replied, "but
she very quickly recovered herself."</p>

<p>"It seemed, in fact, to be a considerable shock
to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Were you in the room when this young man,
James Layton, burst in?"</p>

<p>"I was. Monsieur Dupont and I had just
arrived."</p>

<p>"It is true that he said that rather than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
allow Miss Manderson to become engaged to
Mr. Copplestone, he would tear her to pieces
with his own hands?"</p>

<p>"Those were his exact words."</p>

<p>The inspector rose.</p>

<p>"I understand that you brought Monsieur
Dupont here with you as your friend?" he remarked
casually.</p>

<p>"Yes. He only arrived in London last
night."</p>

<p>"Do you know him well?"</p>

<p>"Fairly," Tranter replied. "I am under a
great obligation to him. He saved my life
in Paris, a year ago."</p>

<p>"Has he mentioned anything of the business
that has brought him to this country?" the
inspector asked, moving to the door.</p>

<p>"Only that he had come to solve a strange
riddle."</p>

<p>A faint, rather grim smile passed over the
inspector's face.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, sir," he said, opening
the door. "If you will kindly return here at
ten o'clock in the morning&mdash;and bring Monsieur
Dupont with you&mdash;I shall ask you to show
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
me the various places you have referred to in
the garden."</p>

<p>When Tranter returned to the waiting-room,
he found Monsieur Dupont asleep in an armchair.
The room was very quiet. The danseuse
had subsided into an interim condition
of mute tension. Mrs. Astley-Rolfe was
deathly white, but perfectly composed. The
men made occasional remarks to each other.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Astley-Rolfe," the inspector called.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the inspector,
placing a chair for her, "I need
only trouble you with one or
two questions. You will understand
that it is necessary for me to account
for each member of this party, so that I may
know which of them can, or cannot, assist me
in my investigations."</p>

<p>She sat down with a weary movement.
Her hands trembled slightly.</p>

<p>"It is very dreadful," she shuddered. "Such
a frightful crime is inconceivable. Who could
have hated the poor girl so dreadfully?"</p>

<p>"That remains to be discovered," the inspector
returned quietly. "I have no doubt
we shall succeed in clearing it up."</p>

<p>"I hope you will," she said fervently.
"Please ask me any questions you like."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
The inspector kept his eyes fixed on his note-book.</p>

<p>"You went into the garden with the others
after dinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me with whom, and
in what part of the garden, you passed the time
before the crime was discovered?"</p>

<p>"I was alone," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"The whole time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was not feeling very well, and did
not want the trouble of talking. I walked
away by myself."</p>

<p>"You know the way about the garden quite
well?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"In what direction did you walk?"</p>

<p>"To the croquet lawn."</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of the others?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or hear any voices?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nothing until the alarm was given?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. It was an isolated part of the
garden. When I heard Mr. Delamere shouting,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
I ran back to the house, and found them
on the lawn."</p>

<p>The inspector shot a keen glance at her.</p>

<p>"Did you know Miss Manderson well?"</p>

<p>"I had only met her three or four times."</p>

<p>"I suppose&mdash;being one of the most beautiful
women on the American stage, and about to
appear for the first time in London&mdash;you heard
her a good deal talked about?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Her voice was just perceptibly
harder. "People were taking great interest
in her."</p>

<p>"Did you hear her private affairs, and mode
of life, discussed at any time?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or the name of James Layton, the millionaire
philanthropist, mentioned in conjunction
with her's?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam. I need not trouble

your address, in case I should have to ask you

<p>In Tranter's car, its owner and Monsieur
Dupont started, at half-past one, on their
return from the crooked house.</p>

<p>The storm had passed, and the air was
fresh and cool. It was possibly the atmospheric
clearance which accounted for the fact,
that, however, fatigued he had been, or appeared
to be, at the end of his conversation
with the inspector, Monsieur Dupont was now
particularly wide-awake and alert.</p>

Almost to tear that woman to pieces&mdash;to crush
her&mdash;to rend her! And what a woman! <i>Ma

doubtless believe to be unknown to every one

rare occasions that I have done so. I did so
to-night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Tranter exclaimed.</p>

<p>"In that horrible garden, before the crime
was committed," pursued Monsieur Dupont
evenly, "I lost my way. Such a garden must
have been especially designed to cause innocent
people to lose their way. I wandered about.
How I wandered!"</p>

<p>"What did you overhear?" asked Tranter, in
a strained voice.</p>

<p>"A conversation&mdash;between that unfortunate
Mademoiselle Manderson, and yourself."</p>

all. I should not have done so. Understand,

the scene itself, excited me. I listened."</p>

<p>Tranter remained silent.</p>

<p>"I continued to listen, until Mr. Bolsover
found me. He was following that young man,
Layton. I went with him to the river."</p>

<p>Tranter was still silent&mdash;staring straight in
front of him with fixed eyes.</p>

<p>"You saw a picture of weakness," he said,
at last. "I am not proud of it. I should
much prefer to be able to think that no one
had seen it. I gave Inspector Fay an account
of the whole scene, and of my previous acquaintance
with Christine Manderson. He
promised to keep it to himself. I hope you
will do the same."</p>

<p>"I shall indeed," the other assured him.</p>

<p>"I am only human," Tranter went on, with
an effort&mdash;"more human than I thought. I
resisted her once by taking flight. I couldn't
resist her to-night."</p>

<p>He mastered his emotion.</p>

<p>"From the moment she first came into the
room I was helpless. I knew what would come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of it&mdash;but I couldn't tear myself away. It was
the whole spell&mdash;with all the new strength of
memories. I knew she intended to find me
alone in the garden." He paused. "I had to
let her."</p>

<p>"Human nature," said Monsieur Dupont
consolingly, "is human nature."</p>

<p>Silence followed. Monsieur Dupont
thoughtfully puffed at his cigar.</p>

<p>"A crooked house in a crooked garden," he
said, at length, "is a combination from which
all honest people should shrink. Those who
frequent it must be, for the most part, crooked
people. They were, for the most part, crooked
people to-night."</p>

<p>"It was a crooked evening from beginning
to end," Tranter said wearily.</p>

<p>"It was a wicked evening," Monsieur Dupont
declared&mdash;"full of wicked thoughts. A
crime was the natural and logical end to such
an evening. It would have been surprising if
there had not been one."</p>

<p>He smoked vigorously for some moments&mdash;then
made an expansive gesture.</p>

<p>"Are there not," he demanded, "houses and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
gardens and thunder-storms that awaken cruel
and shameful impulses that would never be
aroused in other houses and other gardens and
other storms? Does not the influence of good
and noble decorations uplift us to joy and
patriotism? Why should not the influence of
mean and sinful decorations degrade us to murder
and destruction? The flags that fly over
the innocent revels of children are innocent
flags, and inspire kind feelings and happiness.
But remove the same flags to a Bull-ring, and
they become evil flags, inspiring lust for the
blood and slaughter of helpless creatures&mdash;the
basest of human instincts."</p>

<p>"You are fantastic," said Tranter, with a
gloomy smile.</p>

<p>"In fantasy," returned Monsieur Dupont,
"are the world's greatest truths."</p>

<p>He carefully deposed the ash from his cigar.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me," he went on, "something
more about our strange host to-night&mdash;the
man who chooses so much crookedness to
live in, when there is straightness to be had for
the same price?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"I know very little more about him than I
told you last night," Tranter replied. "He is
wealthy, and very eccentric. He seems to pass
his life in a perpetual effort to be different from
other people."</p>

<p>"He is more than eccentric," Monsieur Dupont
stated. "He is mad. In a few years he
will be a dangerous lunatic. And the Good
God only knows what he may make of himself
in the meantime."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of strange stories about
him," Tranter said. "But I have always
looked on them as greatly exaggerated."</p>

<p>"Probably," Monsieur Dupont remarked,
"they were true."</p>

<p>"Whatever his reputation may be, women
seem very ready to put up with his eccentricities,
or pander to them, in return, no doubt,
for big inroads into his banking account. He
is very free with his money where the opposite
sex is concerned."</p>

<p>"It is always so," said Monsieur Dupont,
"with such men."</p>

<p>"He mixes chiefly in theatrical and bohemian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
circles&mdash;and often by no means the most
desirable of those. The better people look
askance on him&mdash;but he is supremely indifferent
to the opinions of others, and to all the
conventions. Whatever he takes it into his
head to do he does, quite regardless of the
approval or disapproval of other people. He
is certainly not a man I would introduce to any
woman who possessed even the smallest degree
of physical attraction. He is supposed to be
quite unscrupulous in the attainment of his
objects."</p>

<p>"Most of us are," said Monsieur Dupont.
"But we dislike to admit it."</p>

<p>He looked steadily out of the window for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, turning back, "what he
does with the rest of that house."</p>

<p>"The rest of the house?" Tranter repeated.</p>

<p>"It is very large," said Monsieur Dupont.
"It is large enough for twenty men."</p>

<p>"In this country," Tranter smiled, "there is
no law against one man living in a house large
enough for twenty, if he chooses."</p>

<p>"When only a small part of a house is used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
for ordinary purposes," remarked Monsieur
Dupont, "the remainder is often used for
extraordinary ones."</p>

<p>"You know as much of the house as I do,"
Tranter returned.</p>

<p>"As a practical man," Monsieur Dupont
continued, "you may smile when I speak of
such a thing as 'psychic intuition.' But you
may smile, and again you may smile. I possess
that intuition strongly. It has been of great
use to me. The moment I entered that house
to-night, I knew it was a house of sin. I knew
there were hidden things in it&mdash;things that
were not for honest eyes to see. I do not say&mdash;at
present&mdash;that they have any connection
with the crime. But they are there."</p>

<p>"I do not smile at such instincts," Tranter
said. "I quite admit that there is a strange,
uncanny atmosphere about the place. And if
there are secrets in it, I am equally ready to
admit that they are probably bad ones."</p>

<p>"They are bad ones," declared Monsieur
Dupont. "They could not be anything but bad
ones. When that excellent Inspector Fay has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
solved the mystery of the garden, he would be
wise to turn his attention to the secrets of the
house."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Did Layton kill her?" Tranter asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The evidence is against him," he replied
judicially. "Your Coroner's jury will find him
guilty, and the police will not look further.
They will build up a strong case. They
will doubtless find that he was cruelly
treated by that poor girl, and was furious to
know that she was engaged to another man.
He threatened, in the presence of many witnesses,
to kill her in a horrible way. He was
seen later in the garden, and afterwards she
was found&mdash;killed in exactly that horrible way.
Who would not say that in his rage and jealousy
he had fulfilled his threat? Every one will
be perfectly satisfied. It is enough for justice
if the most likely person is hanged. And, so
far, he is not only the most likely, but the only,
person."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," Tranter acknowledged. "But&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
didn't look like a murderer. He looked
a good fellow. Is there no other alternative?"</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> an alternative," said Monsieur
Dupont steadily.</p>

<p>"There is?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont smoked composedly for a
minute.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said&mdash;"are you inclined for
an adventure?"</p>

<p>"I am rather busy," Tranter replied.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Suppose ... I were to declare to you
positively that James Layton is innocent&mdash;that
he did not commit that crime in the crooked
garden to-night&mdash;and that I do not intend to
allow him to be hanged for a crime that he did
not commit&mdash;would you give a certain amount
of your time to help me to save him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I will do anything I can."</p>

<p>"Then," said Monsieur Dupont, "I answer
the question you asked a moment ago. He
did <i>not</i> kill her."</p>

<p>"Who did?" Tranter demanded, looking at
him in astonishment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"That is another matter. It is one thing to
say who did not&mdash;but quite another to say who
did. That is for us to discover. There will
be very little time. I think I can promise you
excitement. Possibly there will be danger.
You do not object to that?"</p>

<p>"I have faced a certain amount of danger in
my time," Tranter replied.</p>

<p>"Good," said Monsieur Dupont. "Then we
will set ourselves&mdash;quite apart from the efforts
of our friend, Inspector Fay&mdash;to solve the mystery
of the crooked garden. And we will not
speak a word to any one of our intention."</p>

<p>"You seem to have some very definite ideas
on the subject already," Tranter observed.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," demurred Monsieur Dupont&mdash;"do
not credit me with the superhuman. We have
a very difficult task before us."</p>

<p>"But what of your other object," Tranter
inquired&mdash;"the 'riddle' that you came over to
solve?"</p>

<p>"It may be," Monsieur Dupont replied carefully,
"that there is some connection between
my riddle and this dreadful affair to-night.
At present I cannot say. Only events themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
can prove that. But that very possibility
compels me to take up a peculiar attitude&mdash;unfortunately
a most necessary one. If you will assist me&mdash;as I beg you to
do&mdash;you must be content to follow my guidance and instructions
without question, and remain, as you call
it, in the dark, until the time comes for all to
be told."</p>

<p>"You are certainly the most mysterious person
I have ever met!" Tranter exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It is not that I have the smallest doubt of
yourself or your discretion," Monsieur Dupont
hastened to explain. "On the contrary. It
is simply that my position at this moment is an
extraordinary one, and I cannot do what would
seem to be the natural and ordinary thing.
Will you help me on that understanding?"</p>

<p>"I will help you in any case," Tranter agreed,
smiling slightly at his companion's intense
seriousness. "What is to be my first task?"</p>

<p>"Your first task," said Monsieur Dupont
gravely, "is to deposit me at the Hotel Savoy,
and call for me later on your way back to Richmond."</p>

<p>Tranter spoke some instructions through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the speaking-tube to the chauffeur. When he
turned again, Monsieur Dupont was asleep.
He did not open his eyes again until the car
stopped at the Savoy.</p>

<p>Entering the hotel, he ascended to his room.
In it, he mixed himself a whisky-and-soda, sat
down at the writing-table, and unlocked a
despatch-box.</p>

<p>He took out two photographs&mdash;each of a
remarkably beautiful woman.</p>

<p>Under one was neatly written&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colette d'Orsel. Nice. August 1900.</i></p>

<p>And under the other&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Margaret McCall. Boston. Dec. 1910.</i></p>

<p>From his pocket he took the photograph
which the inspector had allowed him to appropriate,
and laid it beside the others. The face
that smiled up at him was the most beautiful
of the three.</p>

<p>He dipped a pen in the ink, and wrote under
it, in the same neat handwriting&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Christine Manderson. London. July 1919.</i></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Without Trace</span></p>


<p>At ten o'clock, Tranter and Monsieur
Dupont stood with Inspector Fay
in the garden. The Rev. Percival
Delamere joined them a few minutes
later, and the theatrical manager arrived
shortly afterwards. Finally, still in the same
half-dazed condition, George Copplestone
emerged from the house.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," Monsieur Dupont whispered
quickly. "Look at that man!"</p>

<p>His face was white, with a sickly pasty
whiteness. In the few hours that had passed
he seemed to have wasted to a startling gauntness.
His cheeks were drawn, his sunken eyes
dull and filmy. He moved slowly and heavily,
as if compelling himself under an utter weariness.</p>

<p>"What do you want first?" he asked the inspector
curtly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
"First," replied Inspector Fay, "I want to
be shown the spot where the body was found."</p>

<p>Copplestone led the way across the lawns.
In the daylight Monsieur Dupont eagerly followed
the maze of winding paths and hedges
that had imprisoned him so helplessly in the
darkness. It was a veritable looking-glass
garden. The end of every path mocked its beginning.
To reach an object it was necessary
to walk away from it. To arrive at the bank
of the river, Copplestone conducted his followers
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"This garden might have been designed for
a crime," the inspector remarked, as they
turned yet another corner.</p>

<p>"It was," Monsieur Dupont agreed from
the rear. "It was designed for the most
abominable crime of making men and women
go backwards instead of forwards. And last
night it attained the height of its purpose."</p>

<p>For an instant Copplestone glanced back at
him, a quickening in his dull eyes. A moment
afterwards they turned a final corner, and
emerged on to the broad lawns, sloping down
to the edge of the river.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Copplestone halted, and looked round, measuring
distances. Then he moved on, keeping
close to the trees.</p>

<p>"About here, I think," said the clergyman,
pausing.</p>

<p>Copplestone stopped a few paces ahead.</p>

<p>"It was very dark," he said, looking at the
ground. "I don't think I knew exactly where
we were. As near as I can judge, it was just
here."</p>

<p>"There ought to have been some sign left
to mark the place when the body was taken
away," the inspector said sharply.</p>

<p>"You will find," said the quiet voice of Monsieur
Dupont, "a pencil in the ground at the
exact spot. It is a useful pencil, and I should
be obliged if you would kindly return it to
me."</p>

<p>The inspector shot him a rather grim smile.
All, except Copplestone, bent down to look for
the sign.</p>

<p>"Here it is," Tranter exclaimed, pulling a
pencil out of the ground. They stood aside to
give the inspector room.</p>

<p>"The rain has washed away any traces that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
might have helped us," that official grumbled,
after a fruitless search.</p>

<p>"And even if it had not," the manager observed,
"you would only have found traces of
all of us, as we were all here."</p>

<p>The inspector continued his examination.
Copplestone stood apart, his eyes fixed on the
river. He did not appear to be taking the
slightest interest in the proceedings.</p>

<p>"In what position was the body lying?"
the inspector asked, looking up at the clergyman.</p>

<p>"It was so horribly contorted that it is difficult
to say in what position it <i>was</i> lying,"
the latter replied, bending down beside him.
"The head, I think, lay towards the river, and
the feet towards the trees."</p>

<p>"It was so when we came," Copplestone corroborated,
without turning his head.</p>

<p>"There are no signs of a struggle here,"
said the inspector, straightening himself after
another pause. "If there had been one, some
of the heavier indications might have remained
in spite of the rain."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
"It is possible," Monsieur Dupont suggested,
"that the body was carried here from the place
where the struggle did take place."</p>

<p>"Quite possible," the inspector agreed. He
turned to Tranter. "Will you show us now,
Mr. Tranter, where you parted from Miss
Manderson?"</p>

<p>"I am not familiar with the garden," Tranter
replied. "I only know, as I told you last night,
that we had just passed under some arches
across the path. I do not know where they
are."</p>

<p>"Mr. Copplestone will show us," said the
inspector.</p>

<p>Copplestone started at the sound of his own
name, and turned to them.</p>

<p>"What next?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"The rose arches," returned the inspector.</p>

<p>Copplestone indicated an opening in the trees,
some distance ahead of them.</p>

<p>"Over here," he directed, moving towards
it.</p>

<p>There were twelve ornamental arches, overgrown
with roses. Monsieur Dupont looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
at the wealth of flowers almost with reverence.</p>

<p>"So far," he muttered, "the only innocent
things I have seen in this garden."</p>

<p>Tranter stopped at a point where several
paths intersected.</p>

<p>"I left her here," he said. "I went down
that path to the right, which she told me would
lead to the main lawns where I should be most
likely to Mr. Copplestone. She said she was
going straight back to the house."</p>

<p>"She should have taken that path," Copplestone
said, turning to one in another direction.
"That is the way to the house."</p>

<p>"Did she know the garden well?" asked the
inspector.</p>

<p>"Perfectly well."</p>

<p>"Still, she might easily have taken a wrong
turning in the darkness."</p>

<p>"She might. But it is about the straightest
path in the garden. I don't think she
would have made a mistake."</p>

<p>Slowly and carefully Inspector Fay followed
the path to the house, under the guidance of
Copplestone. Every yard of the way was examined,
but yielded nothing. The inspector's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
face became darker and darker. He stopped
when they turned a corner and found themselves
at the house.</p>

<p>"She could not possibly have got so far as
this before the attack was made," he said discontentedly.</p>

<p>"Impossible," agreed the manager. "If the
murderer had killed her here, he would have
left her here. He would not have taken the
risk of dragging her all the way to the river."</p>

<p>"It seems a curious thing," the clergyman
remarked, "that apparently she did not utter
any cry for help."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Monsieur Dupont quietly.</p>

<p>He looked at the clergyman with a new interest.
Copplestone also glanced at him
quickly.</p>

<p>"Even the thunder would hardly have
drowned a sharp cry, and some one would
surely have heard it."</p>

<p>"Probably she hadn't time," suggested the
manager. "No doubt he sprang out and attacked
her from the back. He must have been
as quick as the lightning itself."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont drew Tranter aside.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
"Our clerical friend does not realize the
importance of his own point," he said softly.
"But he has put his finger on the key to the
whole mystery."</p>

<p>"The key?" Tranter repeated.</p>

<p>"If Christine Manderson had uttered a cry
for help, this would have been a simple,
straightforward case," said Monsieur Dupont.
"In the fact that she did not lies the whole
secret of the crime."</p>

<p>"Bolsover's reason would seem to be the
obvious one," Tranter returned. "The assault
must have been made so quickly that
she had no time."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bolsover's reason is, as you say, the
obvious one," admitted Monsieur Dupont.
"But it is not the correct one. I have already
warned Inspector Fay to disregard the obvious.
If he will not take my advice, that is his affair."</p>

<p>"But what do you mean?" asked Tranter.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's voice sank lower.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that a cry for help would
have completely transformed the whole case?
It would have brought it down in one crash to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
a human level. It is the silence&mdash;the utter,
horrible silence&mdash;that makes it what it is. It
is the silence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector's voice recalled them.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Bolsover, just whereabouts was
Layton when you disturbed him?"</p>

<p>"He was sneaking round there," the manager
replied, pointing to a corner of the house,
"towards the drawing-room windows."</p>

<p>"Which path did he run to when he saw
you?"</p>

<p>"That one&mdash;to the river."</p>

<p>"Does that path communicate anywhere with
the one which we presume Miss Manderson
was following to the house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Copplestone.</p>

<p>They moved along the path indicated by the
manager. It twisted about unproductively for
some distance.</p>

<p>"How far was he in front of you?" asked
the inspector.</p>

<p>"I don't know," confessed the manager.
"I should say about ten yards when we started&mdash;but
I am not much of a runner. I had lost
him altogether before I got here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
They went on.</p>

<p>"That cursed rain," the inspector muttered.</p>

<p>"This is the branch that leads to the other
path," said Copplestone, halting.</p>

<p>"And it was further along there, by that
fir tree that I met Monsieur Dupont," added
the manager.</p>

<p>"That is so," agreed Monsieur Dupont.
"Layton certainly did not come beyond this
point in my direction."</p>

<p>"By taking that branch," the inspector calculated,
"he would have met Miss Manderson
just at the time that the crime was committed."</p>

<p>"He would," said the manager.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont turned again to Tranter.</p>

<p>"We must be quick," he whispered, "Layton
is already hanged."</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem to be much chance for
him," returned Tranter. "It will be a very
strong case. No criminal could complain at
being hanged on such evidence."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Monsieur Dupont slowly,
"so far as the actual crime is concerned, there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
is not a single trace. Not one single trace.
Is it not extraordinary?"</p>

<p>He doubled his fists.</p>

<p>"That luck!" he ground out angrily.
"Again that luck!"</p>

<p>"What luck?" Tranter exclaimed.</p>

<p>"If that most unfortunate young man had
not come here and made a fool of himself last
night, the police might have searched forever
without finding a clue. There is no clue here.
And there was the rain. The very elements
sweep up after the passing of the Destroyer."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" Tranter
cried.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, gentlemen," said the
inspector. "Your evidence will of course be
required at the inquest, of which you will receive
notice. I need not detain you any
longer."</p>

<p>The clergyman and the manager hurried
away. Monsieur Dupont lingered at the inspector's
side, and Tranter strolled back with
Copplestone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
"Well?" queried the inspector. "Not much
doubt about it, is there?"</p>

<p>"You have a strong case," said Monsieur
Dupont. "Very strong."</p>

<p>"You agree with it?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"At all events, I am not in position, at present,
to contradict it."</p>

<p>"You will have your work cut out to build
up another one," said the inspector complacently.
"There isn't a trace."</p>

<p>"That is it," said the other sharply. "There
is no trace. There is never a trace." He
lowered his voice cautiously. "One point I
recommend to you, as I have just recommended
it to Tranter&mdash;that remark of Mr.
Delamere that there was no cry for help."</p>

<p>"What of it?" returned the inspector.</p>

<p>"It is the key," said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>He moved on abruptly, and overtook Tranter.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Builder of Men</span></p>


<p>James Layton occupied two dingy
rooms, in a dilapidated house, situated
between a church and a public-house,
in as squalid and unwholesome a street
as any in the East End of London. In them he
spent such time as was left to him&mdash;and it was
not much&mdash;after his active ministrations
among the denizens of the miserable neighborhood.
They were scantily furnished, and of
comforts there were none. He denied himself
anything beyond the barest necessities of existence,
with the exception of a few books and
pipes, which were the companions of his odd
moments of leisure, and he read and smoked in
a hard wicker chair, destitute even of a cushion.
He ate sparingly, of food scarcely better than
that on which his neighbors subsisted, and
drank little. His clothes were poor, his shirts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
frayed, and his boots patched&mdash;and his income
was a thousand pounds a week.</p>

<p>In his work he was unusually broad-minded
and unprejudiced. He spent none of his time
in efforts to lure the occupants of the public-house
on his left into the church on his right.
Indeed, he was an excellent customer of the
former institution, and was on the best of terms
with its landlord, who was an ex-pugilist after
his kind. He made no discrimination in the
dispensation of his charity. He worked on
the principle that before he reformed a man
he must feed him&mdash;so before he attempted to
deal with the mind he relieved the body. He
was open-handed and unsuspicious&mdash;and wonderfully
beloved. There were hundreds of
people in that street, and many other streets,
who would gladly have laid down their lives
for him&mdash;and who imposed on him shockingly
day after day in the minor matters of life.
The Mad Philanthropist never turned away&mdash;never
refused. He was a builder of Men. No
one knew, or cared, who he was or whence he
came. He never gave account of himself, or
spoke of his own affairs. Curiosity was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
one thing he resented. He enclosed himself, so
far as private matters were concerned, within
the fortifications of a reserve which no one had
succeeded in penetrating. Though he held a
thousand confidences, he made none. In listening
to the experiences of others he never referred
to his own, or even hinted whether
they had been sweet or bitter. He went on
his silent way&mdash;and the world was the better
for him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In his bare sitting-room he sat with his face
between his hands. A girl knelt on the floor
beside him.</p>

<p>She was a remarkable girl. Wild, wayward,
with all the passions&mdash;brimful with untamed
vitality&mdash;incapable of the common restraints.
Her face was neither beautiful, nor,
perhaps, even pretty&mdash;but Diana herself might
have envied the full, lithe figure, the free grace
of her movements. She was the creature of
her desires&mdash;knowing no laws that opposed
them. A Primitive Woman, from the dawn
of the world.</p>

<p>"Jim," she pleaded. "Jim...."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
He made no movement.</p>

<p>"Be a man," she whispered. "Pull yourself
together."</p>

<p>He put her away from him roughly.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd go," he said dully. "I don't
want you here."</p>

<p>Her face grew whiter. Her hands crept to
him again. The light of a great love was in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim," she whispered, "I know I'm not
like she was. I'm not beautiful. I'm not wonderful.
I haven't anything that she had. Oh,
I know all that ... so well."</p>

<p>He uncovered his face&mdash;it was haggard and
bloodless, the face of a man in the throes of a
mental hell&mdash;and looked at her, almost with
revulsion.</p>

<p>"You?" he cried harshly. "You...?
You dare to name yourself to me in the same
breath with her? Get up, and look at yourself!"
He pointed to a cracked mirror on the
mantel-piece. "Look!" he said hoarsely,
thrusting her away from him again. "Do you
see how coarse and heavy and rough you are?
She was light and delicate&mdash;like a snowflake.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
She never seemed to touch the ground. Your
hair is like string&mdash;your hands are large&mdash;your
voice is harsh. Her hair was like silk&mdash;gold
silk in the sunshine. I could see through her
hands. Her voice was music. I want you to
go. You are in my way."</p>

<p>She sprang up, raging.</p>

<p>"She never loved you!" she cried. "She
never cared for you&mdash;or even thought of you!
She wasn't fit to touch you&mdash;to look at you!"</p>

<p>His face was aflame.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"I hate her!" she declared fiercely. "I hate
her memory! I'm glad she's dead!"</p>

<p>He lunged forward from his chair, and
seized her. In his fury he nearly struck her.</p>

<p>"As God's above us," he panted, "one more
word...." His rage choked him. The
words jammed in his throat.</p>

<p>She wrenched herself free. His arms
dropped to his sides. He reeled dizzily.</p>

<p>"You may do what you like to me," she cried
passionately. "I tell you&mdash;I'm glad she's dead!
She deserved to die. She was wicked and
cruel. I think God Himself destroyed her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
He sank back into his chair weakly. A sob
shook him.</p>

<p>"God did not destroy her," he said slowly.
"God never destroys. He only builds. It is
men and women who destroy."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. She came close
to him again, all her anger swallowed up in a
great sympathy.</p>

<p>"Jim," she asked softly ... "was she so
much to you?"</p>

<p>He became suddenly rigid.</p>

<p>"How did you come to know her? She
wasn't your sort. She couldn't have had anything
in common with you. What have you
to do with women like that?"</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed threateningly. Her
questions had struck him into a new alertness.
She noticed that his knees were pressed together.</p>

<p>"The papers said she only came to England
two months ago&mdash;for the first time. It hasn't
all happened since then. I know it hasn't.
There must have been something else. Something
before. What was it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
He sat glaring at her&mdash;locking and unlocking
his hands.</p>

<p>"It all happened since then," he said jerkily.
"I had never seen her before. There was nothing
else."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, Jim," she declared.
"You are hiding something."</p>

<p>He avoided her steady gaze.</p>

<p>"Believe it or not, as you like," he retorted.</p>

<p>"People say there is some secret in your
life," she said. "I believe there is. And I
believe it was her secret too."</p>

<p>He lunged forward again, in a fresh paroxysm
of fury.</p>

<p>"What is it to you?" he cried shrilly&mdash;"or
to any one? Why do you pry? Suppose I
have my secrets. They are no concern of
yours. I give away my money&mdash;my life.
Isn't it enough? What would you be&mdash;what
would any of them be now&mdash;but for me? I
work day and night for others. Can't I keep
my soul to myself?"</p>

<p>"Jim," she said gently, "I'm not prying. I
don't want to know your secrets. I only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
wanted to make it lighter for you, if you'd let
me."</p>

<p>"You can't make it lighter for me," he returned.
"No one can make it lighter. I don't
want to be interfered with. I want to be left
alone. What right have you to try to judge
me?"</p>

<p>"Judge you?" she echoed. "Who could
want to judge you? Why, you are the noblest
man in all the world. No one could do more
good than you do. Every man, woman, and
child here worships you, and would die for
you."</p>

<p>His anger instantly subsided.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" he said greedily&mdash;"tell me that.
That's what I want to hear. Tell me they
worship me&mdash;that no one could do more good
than I do&mdash;that men and women would die for
me. Go on telling me that!"</p>

<p>Her voice thrilled with her love for him.</p>

<p>"You brought us light and life. You have
raised hundreds&mdash;as you raised me&mdash;out of
misery and filth. Think of all the children
you have sent away from this poison into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
green fields and the sunshine&mdash;who would have
died."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" he cried. "Go on! Go on!
All the children...."</p>

<p>"You are building them," she said&mdash;her
whole being transformed with tenderness.
"You are making them fit to be men and
women. They wouldn't have been fit without
you. You are teaching them how to be clean
and happy. You are showing them that they
needn't be the dregs of humanity&mdash;that these
hovels needn't be their world. You are giving
them new interests, new thoughts, new
hopes. Oh, what could be more wonderful&mdash;more
splendid? It is God's own work."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" he cried again. "God's work!
I am doing God's work!"</p>

<p>He paced up and down the room eagerly&mdash;feasting
on her words&mdash;drinking her praises as
an exhausted man might drink an invigorating
draught. He was in the grip of a feverish
energy. His blood was racing.</p>

<p>His quick steps shook the wretched room.
The floor creaked under his tread. A lamp on
the table rattled. The girl watched him nervously.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
She put out a hand to check him, but
he brushed it aside. His looks, his movements,
frightened her. He seemed to be gazing out
beyond the narrow walls into a space of surging
memories, that sported with his reason.
He muttered incoherently, oblivious of her
presence. She grew frightened.</p>

<p>"Jim!" she cried sharply.</p>

<p>He started, and stopped, looking at her vacantly.</p>

<p>"My work," he said restlessly. "I must get
on with my work. I haven't done enough
... nearly enough. I must go on building
... go on giving light."</p>

<p>He let her put a hand on his arm and move
him gently back to his chair. He sat down,
and stared at her in a dazed fashion, as one
returning to consciousness.</p>

<p>"Why haven't you gone?" he said heavily.
"I asked you to go."</p>

<p>"I'm not going, Jim," she returned. "I can't
leave you like this. You're not fit to be left."</p>

<p>His face darkened again.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly fit to be left," he said hardly.
"And I wish to be alone."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
"When you are better, I'll go," she said
quietly&mdash;"if you want me to."</p>

<p>He made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"I am better now," he said wearily. "I
am quite well. I want you to go. Why do
you persist in staying when I want you to go?"</p>

<p>The girl's self-control deserted her. She
burst into a storm of weeping.</p>

<p>"I won't go," she sobbed. "I won't go&mdash;because
you are in trouble&mdash;and I love you.
I don't care whether you want me or not. I
love you."</p>

<p>He heard her indifferently. Neither her
tears nor her passion moved him.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," he snapped. "Love
is nothing to me. I hate the word. You
might as well talk of loving the Monument as
me."</p>

<p>"You lifted me up," she cried. "You saved
my soul and body. I was lower than any of
the others before you came. You taught me&mdash;and
I've tried to learn your lessons. But,
oh, if you didn't mean me to love you, you
should have left me where I was."</p>

<p>"You were a good girl," he said, with tired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
tolerance. "You learnt well. But I didn't
mean you to love me. I don't want you to love
me. What I have done for you was only part
of my work&mdash;like the others. I don't want
any woman to love me. I tell you, I hate the
word. It means nothing to me. I only want
to go on...."</p>

<p>Her sobs ceased. She stood very still.
Her face was torn, but he was not looking at
her. She turned, and went slowly towards the
door, her head bowed. She seemed to be
shrunken and small. All her vitality had gone.
She moved like an old woman, weakly.</p>

<p>The door opened before she reached it. Two
men stood in the passage. She started back.
One of them came a few paces into the room,
looking at the man in the chair.</p>

<p>"Mr. James Layton?"</p>

<p>He rose unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I am James Layton. What
do you want?"</p>

<p>"We are police officers, investigating the
murder of Miss Christine Manderson."</p>

<p>The girl uttered a cry, and sprang between
them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
"What do you want with him?" she demanded
fiercely. "He knows nothing about
it. How should he? What is it to do with
him?"</p>

<p>The men looked at her with quick interest.
But Layton silenced her with an imperative
gesture.</p>

<p>"I am at your service," he said quietly.
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"We are instructed to ask you to be kind
enough to return with us to Scotland Yard to
answer a few questions that may assist the
investigation of the crime."</p>

<p>"Certainly," Layton returned, without hesitation.</p>

<p>His face was perfectly calm. He showed
no fear or agitation.</p>

<p>"We have a taxi waiting," the man said.
He spoke to Layton&mdash;but he was looking at the
girl.</p>

<p>"I will come with you at once," Layton replied.</p>

<p>He took up his hat and stick. The girl
leant against the wall panting, a hand pressed
to her heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"Jim," she gasped faintly. "Jim...."</p>

<p>He turned, with the first sign of kindness
he had yet shown to her.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," he said gently. "I
shall be back in an hour or so."</p>

<p>She clutched him desperately.</p>

<p>"You sha'n't go!" she cried wildly. "You
sha'n't go!"</p>

<p>He put her aside firmly.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I go? There is nothing to
be afraid of. I must help if I can."</p>

<p>The door closed behind them. The girl
moved from the wall, and staggered to the
table, leaning on it heavily. She was ashen.
Her lips were gray. She heard them leave the
house&mdash;heard the car start, and listened until
the sound of it died away in the length of the
street. Her strength failed. She sank to her
knees. A moan of agony escaped her.</p>

<p>"For nothing...." she whispered. "Oh,
God ... for nothing...."</p>

<p>She heard a quiet tap at the door, but could
not answer. She saw the door open slowly.
An enormous figure stood on the threshold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
She struggled to her feet.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she murmured fearfully.
"Have you come ... for me?"</p>

<p>The figure squeezed its way through the
narrow doorway, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, you are a friend of Mr.
James Layton, who was taken, a few minutes
ago, to Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried, "yes. I am his friend.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"Before the end of the day, Mr. Layton will
be detained on the charge of murder."</p>

<p>She screamed.</p>

<p>"He didn't do it! He didn't do it!"</p>

<p>"The evidence is strong," said the stranger.
"He threatened her. He was in the garden
when the crime was committed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She raised her hand, as if to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>"In the garden?" she shivered. "He was
in the garden ... then?"</p>

<p>"He will require much assistance," continued
the huge unknown&mdash;"and there is no
time to lose. Will you help him?"</p>

<p>"I would die for him," she choked. "What
can I do?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
The stranger re-opened the door.</p>

<p>"Come with me, mademoiselle," he said
softly&mdash;"and I will tell you."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Triple Alliance</span></p>


<p>He led the girl out of the house.
At the corner of the street a taxi
was waiting. He opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>"To the Hotel Savoy, mademoiselle," he answered.</p>

<p>She hung back.</p>

<p>"Why should I go with you?" she asked
defiantly. "I have never seen you before. I
don't know who you are."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he replied, "your friend is
in great danger. He will not be able to help
himself. If you do not come with me, you will
not be able to help him. And I assure you that
he needs your help."</p>

<p>She got in without another word. He placed
himself beside her, and the car started.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
"Who are you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My name," he told her, "is Dupont&mdash;Victorien
Dupont. I arrived in London from
Paris a few days ago."</p>

<p>"What have you to do with this?" she said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That," he replied, "I cannot at the moment
explain to you. I am concerned in this case
for reasons of my own, which must remain
my own for the present. I was in the garden
when Christine Manderson was killed."</p>

<p>She started, staring at him.</p>

<p>"You were in the garden too?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I was," he affirmed. "And I know that
Monsieur Layton did not kill her."</p>

<p>"He didn't!" she declared. "He couldn't
kill anything. He spends his time giving life&mdash;not
taking it."</p>

<p>"The police will be satisfied that he did, and
they will have a strong case. Unless we can
help him by discovering the truth in time, he
will not be able to clear himself. Are you prepared
to work for him?"</p>

<p>"I told you," she repeated passionately, "I
would die for him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
"It is well," he said. "There will be three
people on his side. You&mdash;my friend, Mr.
Tranter, who was also in the garden&mdash;and
myself. Together we will save him. There
will be separate tasks for us all. Mr. Tranter
will be waiting at the hotel when we arrive,
and we will settle our plan of campaign. Until
then, mademoiselle, let us not refer to the
subject again. Do me the favor thoroughly
to compose yourself. In these matters coolness
is of the utmost importance."</p>

<p>He compressed himself further into his
corner, and closed his eyes. The girl said nothing
more. The rapidity of the whole catastrophe,
and the sudden appearance of this new
adventure bewildered her. The huge mysterious
stranger almost frightened her. Though
his eyes were shut and he made neither sound
nor movement, she felt that he was searching
her, that he was straining all his mental forces
to steal the thoughts that were throbbing
through her mind. As they drew near to their
destination, she fiercely exerted the self-control
that was one of her least developed virtues,
and by the time they reached the Savoy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and Monsieur Dupont opened his eyes, she was
steady and watchful.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," said Monsieur Dupont
softly, "you will be of the greatest assistance.
Already you know the value of silence."</p>

<p>In his private sitting-room they found Tranter
awaiting them.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Monsieur Dupont, "this
lady will work with us. She is much attached
to James Layton, and her assistance will be
most valuable." He turned to her. "Mademoiselle,
I have not the honor...."</p>

<p>"My name's Jenny West," she said, comprehending
the request.</p>

<p>"Where is Layton?" Tranter asked, as Monsieur
Dupont placed a chair for the girl, and
sat down himself.</p>

<p>"By this time," Monsieur Dupont replied,
"he will have arrived at Scotland Yard. Our
friend Inspector Fay will question him, and
he will certainly be detained. As I have just
explained to mademoiselle, he is in great
danger. Unless we succeed in our object, his
position is without hope."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Tears welled up in the girl's eyes, but she
checked them with an effort.</p>

<p>"I wish," Monsieur Dupont continued, with
careful emphasis, "that my own position also
should be clearly understood, in so far as I am
at liberty to explain it. I cannot yet tell you
how I come to be interested in this affair.
Soon I may do so&mdash;but until then you must be
content to take me on trust, and to accept my
assurance that I am fully qualified to direct
you. Are you willing to follow my instructions
without question&mdash;to save this innocent
man, who will be accused of a horrible crime
which he did not commit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the girl cried. "I am ready. I
will do anything."</p>

<p>"And I," said Tranter.</p>

<p>"The directions I give may seem to be
strange," Monsieur Dupont went on impressively&mdash;"but
they must be followed. The errands
on which I send you may seem to be unimportant
and even foolish&mdash;but they must be
carried out. Do not look for explanations,
until I make them. I give account to no one.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Those who work with me work much in the
dark&mdash;but they reach the light. There must
be no hesitation. Is that understood?"</p>

<p>Again the others agreed.</p>

<p>"Then," said Monsieur Dupont confidently,
"we shall succeed. Layton will be saved&mdash;but
it will be a hard and difficult task. The first
law I have to impose on you is&mdash;silence. Complete
silence, to every one except myself."</p>

<p>He turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"At three o'clock this afternoon, mademoiselle,
unless you hear from me to the contrary,
you will go to Scotland Yard, where Mr. Layton
will be detained. That I shall verify by
telephone. You will see him, and you will tell
him this: You will say that I, Dupont, know
how and why Christine Manderson died&mdash;that
I, and those with me, will not allow the innocent
to suffer&mdash;and that he shall be delivered
from this charge. And say to him, also, anything
from yourself that you may wish to say."</p>

<p>They were both gazing at him blankly.</p>

<p>"You know?" the girl gasped. "You know
who killed her?"</p>

<p>The great Frenchman seemed to develop before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
their eyes into a figure of tremendous
menace, every inch of him alive with implacable,
relentless purpose.</p>

<p>"I know," he declared slowly, "just what
I have told you&mdash;how and why she died. Ask
me no more. Remember our conditions.
There must be no questions until the time
comes."</p>

<p>He rose, and took an envelope from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Certain things that I shall ask you to do,
mademoiselle, may involve expense. In this
envelope you will find a sufficient sum. Do
not hesitate to accept it. Ample funds are at
our command. When you return from Scotland
Yard, report to me here. If I am not in,
wait for me. And, above all, remember&mdash;silence."</p>

<p>He opened the door, and bowed her out.
Then he turned to Tranter with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean," Tranter exclaimed,
"that you know the truth of the crime?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont offered him a cigar, and
lit one himself with great composure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
"I know just as much about the crime, my
friend, as I have said. I repeat&mdash;I know how
and why that unfortunate woman died. Who,
or what, caused her to die is another matter,
which we are setting ourselves to solve."</p>

<p>"You are certain that Layton is innocent?"</p>

<p>"James Layton did not commit the crime,"
Monsieur Dupont returned firmly. "But he
will be hanged for it&mdash;if we are not in time."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tranter, "what is there for me
to do?"</p>

<p>"For you," replied Monsieur Dupont,
"there is the most important task in the case,
so far. And the most dangerous. Within
twenty-four hours you must discover, and bring
to me here, the secret of the Crooked House."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" Tranter exclaimed, taken
aback, "how on earth am I to do that?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," Monsieur Dupont admitted.
"Nor have I any helpful suggestions to
make. The method of procedure I leave to
you."</p>

<p>"Housebreaking is entirely out of my province,"
Tranter objected. "And the secret of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that house, if there is one, is likely to be very
well guarded."</p>

<p>"Probably," agreed Monsieur Dupont.
"But the fact remains that before the end of
the next twenty-four hours I must have that
secret&mdash;and you are the person who must bring
it to me."</p>

<p>Tranter took up his hat and stick, without
further protest.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said stoutly. "I will do my
best."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"It is one o'clock," he said, opening the door.
"At one o'clock to-morrow I shall be waiting
for you in this room."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Gluckstein In Confidence</span></p>


<p>Mrs. Astley-Rolfe invariably
received her creditors in pink
deshabille.</p>

<p>The financier, Mr. Solomon
Gluckstein, original and senior representative
of John Brown &amp; Co., Jermyn Street, was particularly
fond of pink, and extremely susceptible
to deshabille. Whiskey-and-soda, personally
prepared for him in sufficient strength by
his charming debtor, increased the fondness
and the susceptibility.</p>

<p>"Ma tear lady," said Mr. Gluckstein, with
desperate firmness, "I have come on an unplethant
errand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Astley-Rolfe pouted petulantly.</p>

<p>"Am I to have no peace?" she complained,
from an alluring attitude on a couch. "Isn't
it enough to have gone through the last two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
days? Look at me. I am a nervous wreck."</p>

<p>"Then all women wouldth with to be nervouth
wrecks," said Mr. Gluckstein gallantly.</p>

<p>"I believe that odious detective actually
imagined at the beginning that I might have
murdered the poor girl."</p>

<p>"Nonthenth," the financier assured her.</p>

<p>"I have scarcely had any sleep," she went
on reproachfully. "It is a wonder I am not
thoroughly ill. And now you&mdash;from whom I
should have expected consideration&mdash;come
here with a face like a rock, and announce your
intention to be unpleasant. If I didn't know
you so well, I might have believed you."</p>

<p>Mr. Gluckstein glanced towards the door,
and drew his chair closer to her.</p>

<p>"Let us understand each other," he said deliberately.
"At the present time you owe me
a large thum of money."</p>

<p>"Gospel truth," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Very much more than you could pothibly
pay, if I came down on you."</p>

<p>She uttered a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"At last you realize that!" she exclaimed
thankfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
"Also," continued Mr. Gluckstein, "you owe
money to various other people."</p>

<p>"Your veracity," she confessed, "is beyond
question."</p>

<p>"Almosth ath much ath you owe to me."</p>

<p>"Quite as much," she said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"And you owe me," he continued&mdash;"twelve
thousand poundth."</p>

<p>"The first time I have looked the evil fully
in the face," she shuddered.</p>

<p>His small eyes regarded her intently.</p>

<p>"The last half of that&mdash;I lent to you on a
certain understanding."</p>

<p>"Understanding?" she echoed languidly.</p>

<p>"Yeth."</p>

<p>"What did you understand?"</p>

<p>"That you intended to become engaged to
George Copplesthone, who would pay your
debths when you married him."</p>

<p>A quick change swept over her. She became
hard and calculating.</p>

<p>"Well?" she returned.</p>

<p>"You have not become engaged to him."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Some one elth became engaged to him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
"Yes," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"That doth not look," he concluded, "like
fulfillment of the understanding."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it?" she retorted.</p>

<p>He glanced again at the door, and came still
closer.</p>

<p>"Lithen," he said slowly. "I have been
your friendth. I have done for you what I
would not have done for any one elth. I have
treated you fairly, and I have never prethed
you."</p>

<p>She softened immediately.</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to me," she said
gratefully.</p>

<p>"You muth be my friendth too. I muth tell
you my thecret. Promith me faithfully that
you will keep it."</p>

<p>She looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Certainly I will keep it," she agreed.</p>

<p>"Five days ago," Mr. Gluckstein informed
her painfully, "my partner abthconded, and left
me almosth a ruined man."</p>

<p>Her face expressed genuine sympathy.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said feelingly.
"What a dreadful blow for you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"It ith unnethecessary to explain bithness
details to you," the financier proceeded. "My
working capital hath gone, and the fact thimply
is that I cannot carry on&mdash;unleth&mdash;&mdash;" he
paused to give his words additional emphasis,
"unleth you repay me my twelve thousand
poundth in full within two months."</p>

<p>"Two months?" she exclaimed blankly.</p>

<p>"Two months," he repeatedly firmly. "That
ith the utmost time I can give you. Have you
any other means of raithing the money?"</p>

<p>"Not a ghost of one," she replied frankly.
"I might as well try to push over the Marble
Arch as raise a single thousand."</p>

<p>"Then," he said steadily, "if you do not
marry Copplesthone I am a bankrupt&mdash;and a
bankrupt I will not be."</p>

<p>"I shall marry him," she said. "I told you
I should&mdash;and I shall. You will have your
money."</p>

<p>"I believed you," he returned. "But another
woman beat you."</p>

<p>She looked away from him.</p>

<p>"Did she?" she replied evenly.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
"When Copplesthone announthed his engagement
to Mith Manderthon," the financier went
on, "I stood ruined. I admit it. I stood
ruined by your defeat. That ith the thecret
that you muth keep. I was sure that you had
no other means of paying me back. Nothing
could save me but a miraculouth removal of the
obstacle."</p>

<p>"The obstacle was removed," she said, in the
same even tone.</p>

<p>He shuddered.</p>

<p>"It wath. The obstacle that stood between
you and Copplesthone, and me and ruination,
wath removed. It was a ghastly thing, and
we are very thorry. But let uth be candid.
It wath to our advantage."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed slowly&mdash;"it was to our
advantage."</p>

<p>"There must not be another obstacle," he
said.</p>

<p>"There will not be another," she replied.
"George Copplestone will marry me&mdash;and you
shall have your twelve thousand pounds, as I
promised. You need not be anxious."</p>

<p>He looked round the luxurious room, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
sighed deeply. It surprised her that she had
not noticed before how much he had aged.</p>

<p>"I must begin again," he said. "I am getting
old&mdash;but I will rebuild my fortune. I
will not be the only poor Jew in London."</p>

<p>"You have been a good friend to me," she
said gently. "I am very sorry."</p>

<p>He paused to finish his drink, but his crafty
eyes never left her face. She did not meet
them.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said, in a slightly lower tone,
replacing his empty glass on the table, "what
the police will discover."</p>

<p>"I should imagine that there is very little
to be discovered," she returned. "There seems
no doubt that it was James Layton, the Mad
Millionaire, as he is called. He will probably
be arrested within the next twenty-four hours.
It appears to be a clear case. He threatened
her&mdash;in front of us all. And he was in the
garden."</p>

<p>"It ought to be enough," he admitted, more
easily. "What more could they want?"</p>

<p>"The evidence is very strong," she said, lazily
settling her deshabille. "Many people have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
been hanged on less. Apparently the police
are satisfied. At least, they have not arrested
either of us."</p>

<p>The financier started violently.</p>

<p>"Either of uth?" he cried, aghast. "What
do you mean, either of uth?"</p>

<p>Her smile was enigmatical.</p>

<p>"As you said just now&mdash;the removal of the
obstacle was to the advantage of both of us."</p>

<p>"But they don't know," he shivered.
"They can't know."</p>

<p>"I hope not," she said shortly.</p>

<p>Perspiration began to stand out on his forehead.
He had lost color considerably.</p>

<p>"You promised to keep my thecret," he exclaimed
nervously. "Noth a word to any
one."</p>

<p>"I shall keep my promise," she replied.</p>

<p>"There is no cause for alarm. I don't think
Inspector Fay will trouble us."</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door. They turned
as the butler entered.</p>

<p>"Inspector Fay would like to see you for a
few minutes, madam."</p>

<p>They looked at each other. The financier
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
was agitated. The woman was perfectly calm.</p>

<p>"Talk of the devil!" she smiled.</p>

<p>Mr. Gluckstein gripped his hat, stick, and
gloves, and rose hurriedly.</p>

<p>"He must not see me here," he said jerkily.
"Let me out another way."</p>

<p>"Go through there," she said, pointing to
a door at the opposite end of the room, "and
when he has come in, Parker will let you out.
Bring the inspector in, Parker."</p>

<p>The financier did not wait to shake hands.</p>

<p>"Remember," he whispered passing her&mdash;"both
your promises."</p>

<p>"They will be kept," she said.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Wit of the Pink Lady</span></p>


<p>Inspector Fay entered the room at
one end a few seconds after Mr. Gluckstein
left it at the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Astley-Rolfe greeted him in a
friendly fashion. She showed considerable
strain&mdash;but, otherwise, was looking her best.
And her best was delightful.</p>

<p>"Good morning, inspector," she said languidly.</p>

<p>"Good morning, madam." He glanced
back to make certain that the door was closed.
"I trust you have recovered from the shock of
the crime."</p>

<p>"I still feel it very much," she replied, shuddering.
"It was the most horrible experience
I have ever had. To think of seeing that poor
girl alive and well one minute, and the next&mdash;like
that. It's too dreadful to think of."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
"It was certainly a most disgusting crime,"
the inspector agreed.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was James Layton?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I cannot make any statement
at present," he replied. "Our investigations
are proceeding as quickly as possible. I hope
we shall clear it up in a few days."</p>

<p>"I hope you will," she declared fervently.
"Such a brutal criminal can expect no mercy."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," continued the inspector,
"I should be much obliged if you would
kindly give me a little information."</p>

<p>"Certainly," she said readily. "Sit down."</p>

<p>He sat down, facing her. She made a
charming picture. But Inspector Fay had
been taken in by charming women several times
during the early part of his career, and at this
stage of it was as impervious as an oyster.</p>

<p>"Please understand," he began, "that in asking
these questions I am making no insinuations
or suggestions of any kind. It is necessary
to establish certain facts."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," she assured him.
"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what you were saying to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Mr. Copplestone in the garden, before Mr.
Tranter came to tell him that Miss Manderson
had gone into the house."</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>"I?" she exclaimed. "I was not with Mr.
Copplestone."</p>

<p>He remained silent.</p>

<p>"I told you, I was not with any one. I did
not feel quite myself, and strolled about alone."</p>

<p>The inspector's face was quite impassive.</p>

<p>"You wish me to accept that answer?" he
asked quietly.</p>

<p>She stiffened haughtily.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>"I mean that you wish that answer to be
accepted as the truth?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Are you suggesting that it is
not?"</p>

<p>"I am suggesting nothing," he returned,
with unruffled composure. "But I must tell
you that if I am to accept that answer, it may
have serious consequences."</p>

<p>"Serious consequences?" she echoed,
startled.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
"For whom?"</p>

<p>"Possibly for Mr. Copplestone himself."</p>

<p>Signs of uneasiness began to appear, in spite
of her wonderful self-control.</p>

<p>"For Mr. Copplestone...?"</p>

<p>"For Mr. Copplestone," the inspector affirmed
steadily.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," she said. "Will you
kindly explain?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." His voice dropped slightly.
"Mr. Copplestone lied to me."</p>

<p>"Lied to you?"</p>

<p>"Lied to me," he repeated. "In accounting
for himself, from the time he came out into
the garden after dinner until Mr. Tranter
found him to deliver Miss Manderson's message,
he lied to me deliberately. I want to
know why."</p>

<p>"You had better ask him," she retorted.
"I do not know."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bolsover, the theatrical manager, told
me that he found James Layton lurking by the
house, and called to Mr. Copplestone before
following him. Mr. Copplestone stated that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the reason he did not hear that call was that he
had gone into the house to refill his cigarette-case,
and did not come out again until just before
Mr. Tranter found him after leaving Miss
Manderson. That statement was false."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"He did not go into the house to refill his
cigarette-case. He had had no opportunity
to smoke afterwards, and when I questioned
him his case was almost empty. He may have
gone in for another reason&mdash;&mdash;or he may not
have gone in at all."</p>

<p>"Is it not very trivial?" she said.</p>

<p>"If you had been dealing with crimes and
criminals as long as I have," the inspector returned,
"you would know that nothing is trivial.
At present, Mr. Copplestone's time while the
crime was being committed is unaccounted for&mdash;and
he is detected in a lie. It is not a pleasant
position to be in."</p>

<p>She was silent. Her hands moved nervously.</p>

<p>"What is the use of telling me this?" she
asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
"It occurred to me," he replied, "that you
might be able to extricate him from that position."</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded resentfully.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Can you?" he insisted, watching her closely.</p>

<p>For a moment she paused. There was
malevolence in her gaze.</p>

<p>"I do not know what he was doing," she said
obstinately.</p>

<p>"Madam," said the inspector impressively,
"if George Copplestone stood in the dock in
front of you, and his life depended on the truth
of your answer&mdash;would it still be the same answer?"</p>

<p>She turned on him.</p>

<p>"In the dock? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Would it still be the same answer?" he repeated
sternly.</p>

<p>"Do you suggest that he may have committed
the crime?" she exclaimed contemptuously.
"Its absurd!"</p>

<p>"I told you," he said, "I suggest nothing.
My case must be complete. I want to know
the truth."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Silence followed. She plucked angrily at
the lace edge of her gown. Inspector Fay
waited imperturbably.</p>

<p>"He was with me," she said, at last, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the inspector.</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>"Please go on," he pressed her.</p>

<p>She did not attempt to conceal her resentment
at his insistence. But the inspector's attitude
was compelling.</p>

<p>"We had a private conversation," she said
viciously. "What passed between us concerned
only ourselves."</p>

<p>"I have no wish to pry into that," he told
her. "But I should like to know why both
you and Mr. Copplestone preferred to tell me a
falsehood rather than admit that you were
talking together in the garden."</p>

<p>"We had our reasons," she snapped, "for
not wishing it to be known that we had been
together. We had no time to speak privately
after the crime was discovered, and it evidently
seemed best to both of us, rather than
risk conflicting statements, not to admit that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
we had spoken to each other at all. I hope
you have nothing more to ask me."</p>

<p>The inspector rose.</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to ask you, madam,"
he said politely. "I trust it will not be necessary
for me to trouble you again in this case.
But if it should be&mdash;you will find that in such
serious matters it is always better to speak the
truth. Good morning."</p>

<p>He walked quickly out of the room, leaving
a lady in pink deshabille quivering with an
emotion that was not anger, but a new triumph.</p>

<p>Inspector Fay left the house of the
lady in pink with a satisfied expression on
his face. At the corner of the street he
hailed a taxi, and drove to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Under the watchful eyes of his escort, James
Layton awaited him. The millionaire was
perfectly composed, and appeared to be under
no apprehension as to the outcome of his visit.
He accompanied the inspector to a private
room, and sat down in a comfortable chair
without the smallest sign of alarm.</p>

<p>"Mr. James Layton?" the inspector began,
seating himself at a table.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Layton, I am Inspector Fay&mdash;in charge
of the investigations of the death of Miss
Christine Manderson, at Richmond, on Tuesday
night. I want you to be good enough to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
answer the questions I have to ask you as
clearly as possible."</p>

<p>"Certainly," the young man replied, unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>"To begin with&mdash;did you go to Richmond
on that night?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Were you alone?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Did you call at Mr. Copplestone's house at
half-past eight?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You asked to see Mr. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And he refused to see you?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"What was your object in calling on him,
in that manner, at such an inconvenient time?"</p>

<p>"I had just ascertained that Miss Manderson
had, or was about to, become engaged to
marry him. My object was to tell him that
he was not a fit person to be her husband, and
that I would prevent the marriage at all costs."</p>

<p>"That you would prevent the marriage?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
"Yes."</p>

<p>"Because, in your opinion, he was unworthy
of her?"</p>

<p>"Totally."</p>

<p>"Had you any right to take upon yourself
the control of Miss Manderson's choice of a
husband?"</p>

<p>"No right, perhaps&mdash;as you use the term."</p>

<p>"As any one would use it?"</p>

<p>"To my mind, yes."</p>

<p>"To your mind you had a right to interfere
in that engagement?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"We will come back to that presently," the
inspector proceeded. "What did you do when
Mr. Copplestone refused to see you?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid my excitement got the better
of me. I forced my way past the servant, and
went into a room from which I heard voices,
thinking that he was there with her."</p>

<p>"You knew, then, that she was in the house
at the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I had previously telephoned to her
hotel, and her maid had told me that she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
spending the evening at Copplestone's house."</p>

<p>"I am told you burst into the room uttering
her name."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"But you found only some guests of Mr.
Copplestone's, who had been invited to dinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was there anything strange about the
room?"</p>

<p>"It was decorated in an extraordinary manner."</p>

<p>"I think you made some remark about the
decorations?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did. I had been told something
of Mr. Copplestone's eccentricities, and I inferred
that the engagement was an accomplished
fact, and that the decorations had been
put up in celebration of it."</p>

<p>"Do you remember saying anything else in
the room?"</p>

<p>"I said that rather than allow Miss Manderson
to be engaged to George Copplestone, I
would tear her to pieces with my own hands."</p>

<p>"And utterly destroy her?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
"Yes."</p>

<p>"A somewhat violent announcement," the
inspector observed.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it was."</p>

<p>"You were in a state of great excitement,
were you not?"</p>

<p>"I was very excited."</p>

<p>"Almost beside yourself?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that."</p>

<p>"Were you responsible for your words and
actions at the time?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"You really meant what you said?"</p>

<p>"I meant what I said," the young man declared
calmly.</p>

<p>The inspector was writing rapidly.</p>

<p>"You were then requested to leave the house,
and I think you left quite quietly?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I climbed over the wall into the garden
and waited for an opportunity to get into the
house again and speak to Copplestone or Miss
Manderson."</p>

<p>"You were behaving rather strangely, were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
you not, Mr. Layton?" the inspector asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose I was."</p>

<p>"If you had heard of any one else acting in
the same way, you would have thought that
he could hardly have been in a normal state of
mind?"</p>

<p>"I expect I should."</p>

<p>"Yet you say you were quite yourself?"</p>

<p>"I was quite myself."</p>

<p>"And prepared to carry out your threat?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what I was prepared to do.
I did not carry it out."</p>

<p>"Later on, one of the guests, Mr. Bolsover,
found you creeping round the house towards
an open window?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Before he ran after you, do you remember
hearing him call to Mr. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did."</p>

<p>"Was there any answer?"</p>

<p>"I did not hear one."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bolsover then followed you out in
the direction in which the crime was committed?"</p>

<p>"I do not know where the crime was committed,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Layton replied firmly. "I know
nothing of the crime."</p>

<p>"Whoever committed it managed to fulfill
your own threat fairly fully."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, yes."</p>

<p>"Have you any suggestion to make as to
who that person may have been?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What, then, did you do when Mr. Bolsover
ran after you?"</p>

<p>"I eluded him in the darkness, climbed over
the wall again, and went away."</p>

<p>"Without having fulfilled your object?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Had you seen anything at all of Miss Manderson,
or Mr. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>There was a pause. James Layton waited
quietly while the inspector finished off his
notes. His face was a trifle paler than before,
but he betrayed no sign of agitation.</p>

<p>"Now," resumed the inspector, "let us go
back. You said that to your mind you had a
right to interfere in Miss Manderson's engagement?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"I did."</p>

<p>"What had given you that right?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," the young man returned
courteously&mdash;"but I decline to answer that
question."</p>

<p>"When and where did you first meet her?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"You would be wiser to do so."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>The inspector's face darkened.</p>

<p>"Mr. Layton," he said, with unmistakable
emphasis, "you had better not decline to answer
any question. I must warn you that your
position may become extremely serious."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Layton remarked quietly,
"that you have already made up your mind
that I am guilty of the crime."</p>

<p>"That is as it may be," replied the inspector.
"I am advising you for your own good. To
refuse to answer questions is not the way to
allay suspicion&mdash;but to increase it."</p>

<p>"I realize that," the young man said. "But
I still refuse."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay leant back in his chair patiently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
"Come, Mr. Layton, you will only put us to
the trouble and delay of proving what you
might as well tell us at once. And it will do
you no good."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to cause you any additional
trouble," Layton replied. "But I have
my reasons."</p>

<p>"Let me help you," continued the inspector.
"I have had inquiries made at Miss Manderson's
hotel, at the theater at which she was to
have appeared, of her maid, and various other
sources. We have got her time pretty well
accounted for. It seems that you have not
seen her at all since she arrived in this country
two months ago. Is that so?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Anyway, if you did see her once or twice,
there were certainly no opportunities for anything
to develop between you to account for
your behavior, or justify to the right to which
you considered yourself entitled. You must
have known her before."</p>

<p>Layton was still silent. The inspector continued
easily.</p>

<p>"I am wondering whether a cable across the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Atlantic would bring me a description of a
certain Michael Cranbourne, once well known
in the United States&mdash;particularly in Chicago&mdash;son
of a multi-millionaire."</p>

<p>James Layton stiffened in his chair. He
had become white and tense.</p>

<p>"A large part in the career of Michael Cranbourne
was played by an adventuress named
Thea Colville&mdash;said, at one time, to have been
the most beautiful woman in America&mdash;and
known later, on the stage in New York, as
Christine Manderson."</p>

<p>The young man rose. On his face there was
a wonderful new dignity and calm&mdash;a relief, as
if some heavy burden had dropped from him
and left him free.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "I am Michael Cranbourne.
I might have admitted it at first.
What do you want now?"</p>

<p>"The whole story," the inspector replied,
motioning him back to his chair.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," he said.</p>

<p>He sat down again. A great contentment
seemed to rest upon him, as on one who reaches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the end of a difficult and tiring journey. There
was a long pause.</p>

<p>"I first met Thea Colville," he began, at
last, "in Chicago, when I was twenty-five&mdash;seven
years ago. She was twenty. It would
be no use attempting to give you an idea of
what she was like. You never saw her alive.
No description could convey an impression of
her beauty&mdash;of her awful fascination. From
the moment I first saw her there was no other
woman in my world. I was engaged to be
married, but I put an end to it. People said I
behaved badly, but I didn't care. I couldn't
look at, or think of, another woman after I
had seen her. She enslaved me. I was hers,
body and soul. She held me helpless. I was
only one of many, but I was a favored one&mdash;at
least, I thought so."</p>

<p>He told his story slowly, in a low voice, without
emotion. He was staring out straight in
front of him, forgetful of his surroundings
and his listener. The past held him.</p>

<p>"My family warned me, and threatened me.
I knew they were telling me the truth&mdash;but I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wouldn't listen. I hadn't been brought up to
care what results my actions brought on other
people. I thought only of myself&mdash;of the indulgence
of my own desires. I lived a useless,
contemptible life&mdash;entirely without scruples or
restraints. There was scarcely a vice that I
was not steeped in&mdash;hardly a sin that I had not
explored. I had enough money to gratify all
my senses. Nothing was beneath me. I
plunged into every depravity. I made new
depths for myself." He clenched his hands.
"And I led others after me."</p>

<p>There was another pause. He sat rigid.
The inspector waited patiently.</p>

<p>"I need not trouble you with unnecessary
details," the low voice went on. "It is enough
that for her sake I sacrificed all my prospects&mdash;I
threw away my heritage. To keep her for
myself I squandered every cent I could lay my
hands on. I robbed my own brother. I
forged my father's name. I did ... other
things. It was only the generosity of my
family that kept me from gaol. And Thea
threw me over."</p>

<p>"Apparently," the inspector remarked, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
unsympathetically, "her standard of morality
was on a somewhat similar level."</p>

<p>"She is dead," said the young man gently.
"'<i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i>'"</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"As you please," he said. "Go on."</p>

<p>"She refused to see me&mdash;to have anything
more to do with me. She cut me out of her
life with one stroke. For the first time I knew
she hadn't cared. That broke me. I was very
ill. For a year I knew no one. I couldn't
hear or speak. They fed me like a child.
They thought I was mad"&mdash;his eyes began to
gleam unnaturally, his words quickened&mdash;"but
in reality I was in the presence of God. I was
in the image I had brought upon my soul&mdash;black,
hideous, distorted, reeking with the filth
of my sins. I saw myself&mdash;in all the degradation
I had brought upon the Shape of God.
I saw my own page in the Book of Life. All
the entries were on the debit side. The credit
side was bare. I waited for damnation&mdash;but
there is no damnation. There is only Building.
I went out from the presence of God&mdash;a
Builder."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
His face was transformed. His voice rang
with triumph&mdash;with the pride of victory.</p>

<p>"I came to myself. It was like waking from
the dead. It was a long time before I recovered
even a little of my strength. Every
hand was against me&mdash;except my mother's.
She stood by me. When she died, a year later,
I inherited the whole of her fortune. The
others tried to take it away from me, but I
fought them. I had new uses for the money.
I came over to this country, and began my
work. For four years I have given myself and
all I have. Go and see for yourself what I
have done. Go and see the men, women, and
children who would die for me. Go and hear
them bless my name. Hear of the lives I have
built&mdash;the light I have brought. I have filled
up my credit side. I have a balance in hand
in the Book of Life."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay remained silent. He was a
severely practical man. Before his mind there
was only the outcome of the interview. The
young man controlled himself with an effort.
His excitement passed. He was again quiet
and composed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
"None of my old passions or inclinations
remained&mdash;except my love for Thea. I
couldn't crush it. I fought against it with all
my strength. I struggled to stamp it out, but
it was unconquerable. Her face was always in
front of me, day and night. Her voice was
always in my ears. I couldn't escape. I heard
nothing more of her until about six weeks ago,
when I saw a photograph of her in one of the
papers under the name of Christine Manderson,
with a statement that she had arrived in
London to play at the Imperial Theater. The
longing to see her again was too strong for
me. Day after day I waited outside the stage-door
of the theater&mdash;until she came, in all her
fatal, maddening beauty. We stood facing
each other ... and she passed me by without
a word."</p>

<p>His voice broke. He pressed his thin hands
together.</p>

<p>"The madness came over me again. The
sight of her fanned all the old flames. I was
on fire. I tried to follow her, but they kept me
out. I wrote to her that night, telling her what
I had done, how I had suffered, and begging,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
imploring her to let me see her. The answer
was a curt note, in the third person, saying
that she declined to receive any communication
from me whatsoever."</p>

<p>Again he paused. The inspector made no
comment.</p>

<p>"I found out where she was staying, what
her plans were, and who were her friends. I
discovered that she had come under the influence
of George Copplestone, who is little better
than I was once. The thought that she was to
be the sport of his depravity drove me to
frenzy. I neglected my work. I could do
nothing. Then I heard that they were on the
point of becoming engaged. The rest you
know. I followed her to Copplestone's house.
She had evidently warned him against me.
I forced my way into the room, calling her by
the name of Christine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?" the inspector asked</p>

<p>"Because it was obvious that she would not
wish the name of Thea Colville to be known to
London. That is all I have to tell you."</p>

<p>The inspector rose.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cranbourne," he said formally, "after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
hearing your story, I am afraid I have no
option but to detain you on suspicion of having
caused the death of Christine Manderson,
otherwise Thea Colville, and to warn you that
anything you say may be used in evidence
against you."</p>

<p>The young man heard him without a
tremor.</p>

<p>"I did not kill her," he said firmly. "God's
will be done."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Birth of the Killer</span></p>


<p>Monsieur Dupont was one of
those fortunate individuals who
can sleep in a train.</p>

<p>He left Paddington at one
o'clock, and slept for an hour, a sleep of childlike
ease and innocence. When he woke the
train was within five minutes of his destination.
He alighted at a small country station, and instituted
inquiries for a conveyance.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, an unimpressionable
horse, attached to a hybrid vehicle, was jogging
him along country lanes which would have
delighted a man with less serious purposes.
But Monsieur Dupont was too much occupied
with the uglinesses of humanity to heed the
beauties of nature. It was not until they arrived
at the outskirts of a small village that
he began to look about him with interest.</p>

<p>It was a lovely spot, nestling in primeval
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
innocence under the shelter of protecting hills.
Monsieur Dupont uttered a heavy sigh, and
spoke, for the first time during the drive, to
the stout, sunburnt lad who conducted the
equipage.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said sorrowfully, "who
could imagine that such a corner of heaven
could have been the cradle of one of the most
terrible tragedies of the world? I feel like
a purveyor of sins, creeping into the preserves
of God."</p>

<p>The startled stare that confronted him was
not helpful to further conversation. The disconcerted
youth vigorously obtained fresh impetus
from their source of progress, and drew
up at length, with obvious relief, before a low,
creeper-covered house, lying in a nest of
flowers.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's gentle knock produced a
rubicund housekeeper, of about eighty, who
blended in perfect harmony with the house, the
creeper, and the flowers.</p>

<p>"Doctor Lessing, if you please, madame,"
said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>He was shown into a small library, opening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
on to the garden. The room was flooded with
sunshine. There were flowers everywhere.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," said Monsieur Dupont, aloud,
"that I should come to ask such questions
here."</p>

<p>He turned as the door opened, and bowed
before a sturdy, white-haired old man, bronzed
with the health of the country.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Dupont?" said the doctor.
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont took a letter from his
pocket, and unfolded it.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I beg you to read this letter. It
is from the French Embassy, and begs assistance
to me in an investigation that I am making."</p>

<p>Doctor Lessing read the letter, and returned
it.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to assist you in any way I
can," he said, courteously. "Please sit down."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont sat down by the open windows
and drank in the fragrance of the garden.</p>

<p>"Doctor Lessing," he began, "I believe it is
for a long time that you have lived in this
beautiful place?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
"For forty-five years," the old doctor smiled
contentedly. "But I am by no means one of
its oldest inhabitants. Lives are long in the
country. To what period do you wish to
refer?"</p>

<p>"A period," Monsieur Dupont replied,
"nearly forty years ago. I do not know
exactly."</p>

<p>"A long stretch," said Doctor Lessing ruefully.
"But my memory shall do its best for
you. That is all I can promise."</p>

<p>"I am engaged," said Monsieur Dupont, "on
an extraordinary quest. I do not think that
any human being has ever been engaged on a
more extraordinary quest."</p>

<p>"A pleasant one, I trust," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"As much to the contrary as it is possible
to imagine."</p>

<p>The doctor murmured a regret and waited
for his huge visitor to continue.</p>

<p>"Do you," Monsieur Dupont inquired, "recollect
the name of Winslowe?"</p>

<p>Doctor Lessing started slightly.</p>

<p>"Winslowe?"</p>

<p>"Oscar Winslowe."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
A keen glance flashed from the doctor's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quickly, "I recollect the
name."</p>

<p>"He lived, I think in this village at the time
I have said?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The reply was a trifle curt.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Monsieur Dupont proceeded
evenly, "there were circumstances in connection
with that name which helped to fix it in
your memory?"</p>

<p>"There were certain circumstances," the
doctor admitted, "which made it a name that I
am unlikely to forget."</p>

<p>"Unpleasant circumstances?" queried Monsieur
Dupont.</p>

<p>"The most unpleasant that have ever occurred
to me in the whole length of my practice."</p>

<p>"It is for that story," said Monsieur Dupont,
"that I have come to ask. May I beg
all the details that you can recall?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will first tell me," the doctor
returned, "for what purpose you require this
information?"</p>

<p>"I require it," Monsieur Dupont replied impressively,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
"to save the life of an innocent
man, who is wrongly accused of the crime
of murder. I require it also prove three
deaths, and possibly to prevent another three."</p>

<p>Again the doctor started. His hands
gripped the arms of his chair.</p>

<p>"Three deaths?" he exclaimed sharply.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Three deaths," repeated Monsieur Dupont.
"Of three very beautiful women."</p>

<p>The doctor sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the story?" said Monsieur
Dupont.</p>

<p>Doctor Lessing sat down again in his chair.
He was considerably shaken. He leant back
and closed his eyes, remaining silent for a few
moments.</p>

<p>"I think," he began at last, "that I can, at
all events, remember the chief facts of the case.
It was such a remarkable and distressing one
that it stands out in the annals of such a peaceful
spot as this, and it has therefore remained
in my memory, though so much else has faded.
But you must make allowances for the flight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of time. Look out of the window to the left,
and you will see a large red house, on the slope
of the hill."</p>

<p>"I see it," said Monsieur Dupont, following
the direction.</p>

<p>"That was Oscar Winslowe's house, forty
years ago. Winslowe was an unprincipled and
dissolute man. He was only about twenty-five
or six at that time, but already he was
sodden with drink, drugs, and vice of every
description. He was the worst kind of blackguard.
But his wife was the exact opposite
to him, a gentle, delicate girl. She was not
beautiful, but her nature more than compensated
for lack of beauty. He had married
her for her money, and treated her abominably.
I became friendly with her, partly because of
the pity I felt for her on account of his treatment,
and partly because I sincerely admired
the beauty of her character. In consequence
of that friendship, I undertook to watch over
her entry into motherhood."</p>

<p>"That is what I want," said Monsieur Dupont.
"Her entry into motherhood."</p>

<p>"The more I saw of her," continued the doctor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
"the greater grew my pity. There have
been wonderful women in the world who have
made history by their patience and endurance&mdash;but
this woman was one of those, equally
brave and equally patient, of whom history
knows nothing. She worshipped her husband,
blindly, dumbly&mdash;as an animal will still love
the man or woman who ill-treats it. She never
uttered a word of complaint or blame. Her
greatest hope was that the advent of the child
would induce from him something of the consideration
and tenderness that he had never
given her. She believed it was some fault,
some shortcoming, of hers that had kept it
from her. It didn't occur to her that it might
be the beauty of another woman."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Monsieur Dupont eagerly.</p>

<p>"She discovered that about three months before
the child was born. I can't remember
how the discovery came about. She followed
him to London&mdash;and found him, even that
short time before the birth of his child, lavishing
on a beautiful society woman all that should
have been hers."</p>

<p>In spite of the years that had passed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
doctor's voice still rose in anger. He paused,
checking himself.</p>

<p>"Before that supreme insult, that shattering
of her hopes, the poor girl lost her reason.
In the state of her health, it was not surprising.
She, who would never have harmed a fly, who
had never wished ill to any one in her life,
became possessed with an awful fury to stamp
out the beauty that had robbed her&mdash;to destroy
the face and body that were more to the man
she loved than her own. The other woman,
undeserving of consideration as she was, narrowly
escaped a horrible punishment. The unfortunate
girl was brought back here, and I
was sent for to attend her. She grew worse
hour after hour. Her mind was completely
unhinged. From a furious hatred of the beauty
of the woman who had wronged her, the mania
increased into a furious hatred of beauty in any
shape or form, and a savage lust to destroy it.
In the house there were many portraits of the
beautiful women of the Winslowe family. She
tore the pictures to shreds. There were
statues and valuable works of art. She
smashed them all to pulp. Her madness was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the most terrible thing I have ever seen. She
had to be forcibly restrained."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont listened intently. There
was an expression of triumph on his face.</p>

<p>"A pitiful story," he said softly.</p>

<p>"She partially recovered in a few weeks,"
the doctor went on, "and before the three
months were up her reason, if not actually
sound again, was at least restored. But she
was a wreck of a woman. There was darkness
all round her. She heard nothing more of
Winslowe. He never came back to the house.
The madness returned when she gave birth to
her child, and she died in an asylum a fortnight
afterwards."</p>

<p>A longer pause followed. The recitation of
his memories moved the good old doctor as
the actual experience must have moved the
young man of forty years before. He rose,
and walked to the window, sniffing the scent
of the flowers with relief.</p>

<p>"She left the care of the child to the nurse
who was devoted to her, with ample funds for
its future. When the affairs were settled up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the nurse took the child away with her, and I
have not seen her since."</p>

<p>He made a relieved gesture.</p>

<p>"That is the whole story," he said.</p>

<p>"The nurse," inquired Monsieur Dupont,
"what was her name?"</p>

<p>"Masters. Miss Elizabeth Masters."</p>

<p>"Is she still alive?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know she is," the doctor replied.
"But I should not have been likely
to have heard of her death, if it had taken
place."</p>

<p>"Can you assist me to discover her address?"</p>

<p>"She wrote to me periodically," Doctor Lessing
returned. "She was an excellent nurse,
and I got her some cases in town. But it is a
long time since I last heard from her. There
may be one or two old letters of hers in my
desk. If you will excuse me for a moment, I
will see if I can find them for you."</p>

<p>He left the room. Monsieur Dupont turned
to the window, and gazed dreamily out into
the sunshine.</p>

<p>"And so," he muttered&mdash;"in this corner of
paradise the Destroyer was born."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Hasty Flight</span></p>


<p>Doctor Lessing re-entered the
room with a letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"The last address I can find," he
said, "is 35, De Vere Terrace,
Streatham. That is sixteen years old, but as
it tells me that she had only just moved in,
you might find her still there."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont made a note of the address.</p>

<p>"There remains only one question," he said,
replacing his pocket-book. "Can you tell me
the name of the child?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't. The child was christened
in the church here, but I was away at
the time, and when I returned Miss Masters
had gone to London."</p>

<p>"It is very important," said Monsieur Dupont.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
"Perhaps I can discover it at the
church?"</p>

<p>"You will not find any one to tell you at
this time," the doctor replied. "But, if you
will leave me your address, I will send over
to the parsonage this evening and ask Mr.
Wickham to turn it up in the register, and
let you know."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont delivered himself of profuse
thanks. Five minutes later he had taken
leave of the old doctor, and was returning to
the station under the guidance of the sunburnt
youth, who was obviously relieved when the
expedition terminated.</p>

<p>He slept peacefully until the train reached
Paddington.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock when he returned to the
Savoy. The girl, Jenny West, was waiting for
him. She was as white as death.</p>

<p>"They have charged him," she sobbed. "He
is remanded for a week."</p>

<p>He laid a hand gently on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," he said. "He will be
saved. I have given my word&mdash;the word of
Dupont&mdash;that he will be saved."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
He sat down at his writing table, and wrote
rapidly for several minutes. He covered four
or five sheets of paper, and placed them in an
envelope.</p>

<p>"Here, mademoiselle," he said, rising, "are
your instructions for to-morrow morning. Do
not read them until you are alone. A car will
be waiting for you here at ten o'clock in the
morning. In the afternoon you will be at
liberty to visit Monsieur Layton. I shall expect
to see you here at one o'clock."</p>

<p>He bowed her out of the room. Half an
hour later, he was on his way to Streatham.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A grim expression settled on his face as the
journey proceeded, yet it was not altogether
unmixed with pity. He was a man of ready
sympathy. The doctor's story had evidently
moved him to view his task with a new compassion.</p>

<p>As his car turned into De Vere Terrace, he
became alert, and scrutinized the houses
closely. They were small semi-detached villas.
He alighted in front of number 35, passed up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the carefully kept front garden, and knocked
at the door.</p>

<p>There was no response. He knocked again,
several times, but the silence of the house remained
undisturbed. He left the door, and
glanced in at the front windows, but the room
was so dark that he could discern nothing.
He walked round to the back. Through the
uncurtained kitchen windows he saw a fire
in the range. It had almost burnt itself out.
There were cooking utensils on the table.
Some pastry was rolled out on a board.
Apparently the household operations had
been somewhat rudely interrupted, and very
hastily abandoned. The back door and windows
were securely fastened. Returning to
the front, he carefully closed the gate, and
knocked at the door of the adjoining house.</p>

<p>The name of the house was "Sans Souci,"
and the door was opened by a lady in rich
purple, with a string of pearls.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont swept off his hat.</p>

<p>"Madame, I make a thousand apologies!
Can you tell me when I shall find Miss Masters
at home."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
His extreme bulk and the fact that he was
not an Englishman seemed to cause the lady
considerable amusement.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," she said engagingly.
"I think she's gone away."</p>

<p>"Away?" Monsieur Dupont echoed.</p>

<p>"She left in a great hurry two hours ago,"
the lady informed him. "In a motor."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont appeared somewhat staggered.</p>

<p>"Two hours ago...." he muttered.</p>

<p>"I heard a noise going on in the house,"
continued the lady, "as if she was packing
quickly. She went off with a couple of boxes,
and seemed very impatient."</p>

<p>"It is most unfortunate," said Monsieur Dupont
mildly. "I have come all the way from
the Strand to see her."</p>

<p>The lady laughed freely.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," she said good-naturedly.
"Won't you come in and rest a bit?"</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "you are very good, but
I must return to the Strand. Would you allow
me to ask you some questions, without finding
me impertinent?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
"What are they?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me if any particular person
was in the habit of visiting Miss Masters?"</p>

<p>The lady stiffened slightly.</p>

<p>"Are you a friend of Miss Masters?" she
inquired, shortly.</p>

<p>"I am not," Monsieur Dupont admitted
frankly. "I have never seen her. It is a few
hours ago that I heard her name for the first
time."</p>

<p>"I really cannot answer any questions to a
stranger," said the lady stiffly. "I don't know
you."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont bowed.</p>

<p>"If you did, madame," he said, "I should
be the proudest of men. Do me the favor to
read this letter."</p>

<p>He produced the letter from the French
Embassy, and handed it to her. She read it,
and was duly impressed.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll do anything for the French
Embassy," she said, returning the letter with
dignity. "Miss Masters wasn't what you
might call a friend of mine. I used to speak
to her because she lived in the next house, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
it didn't go beyond that. She kept very much
to herself. I don't want to say anything at
all unkind, but very few ladies in our set knew
her. Of course it wasn't her fault, but she
was not exactly classy. And when one lives
in a neighborhood like this, it's class that tells."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont bowed again.</p>

<p>"Obviously, madame," he said.</p>

<p>"The only person that used to visit her,"
continued the gratified lady, "was a man who
often used to arrive in the evening and stay the
night. We understood she was an old nurse
of his, or something of the kind, and that he
more or less provided for her."</p>

<p>"And this man, madame&mdash;what was he
like?"</p>

<p>"He was rather tall," she said, "and had a
dark moustache. He was always well dressed,
and looked quite a gentleman."</p>

<p>"You heard his name?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;we never heard his name. I did tell
my house-parlor-maid to try to find out once,
but she couldn't. Miss Masters actually accused
me of prying."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
"We had a bit of a row," said the lady candidly.</p>

<p>"Does she live alone, madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite alone. She does everything for
herself."</p>

<p>"My last question," said Monsieur Dupont,
"may seem remarkable. It is this. Have
strange things appeared to be happening in the
house during the visits of the tall gentleman
with the dark moustache?"</p>

<p>She started, looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>"Strange things?" she repeated slowly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;violent things."</p>

<p>"Well, that's queer," she exclaimed. "As
a matter of fact, we once heard the most
extraordinary noises going on when he was
there. My husband thought of sending in to
ask if anything was the matter."</p>

<p>"What kind of noises, madame?"</p>

<p>"Like as it might be heavy things being
thrown about and smashed," said the lady
elegantly.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont swept off his hat again.</p>

<p>"Thank you, madame," he said&mdash;and went
back to his car.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tranter Attacks the Crooked House</span></p>


<p>In the evening, Tranter set off to the
Crooked House.</p>

<p>It was dark when he reached it, and the
roads were empty. Through the open
lodge gates he slipped into the garden unseen.
The place seemed deserted. The front of the
house showed not a glimmer of light. The
whole ugly shape of it stood out gauntly against
the sky of the summer night. In the shadow
of the trees, he stood watching it, alert to detect
a sign of life. But no such sign appeared.
The Crooked House was as dark and silent as
a tomb.</p>

<p>He crept nearer, keeping under cover of the
trees, and skirted the lawns to the back of the
house. There, also, darkness reigned. No
sound disturbed the stillness. Facing him
were the dark shapes of the trees surrounding
the wing of the house which extended from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the opposite corner. The foliage was so dense
that no part of the wing itself was visible. He
moved quickly across the back of the house,
and reached the trees. As he passed under
them, it seemed that he was feeling his way
among monstrous sentinels of a dark mystery.</p>

<p>A thick hedge loomed up in front of him.
It appeared to surround the entire wing. He
walked round, trying to find a place thin
enough to allow him to push his way through&mdash;but
the hedge was evidently there for the
express purpose of defeating such an intention.
It was impossible to penetrate it, to creep under
it, or to climb over it. At the extremity of
the wing, about which the trees were thickest,
he saw a faint light, escaping round the edge
of a blind.</p>

<p>He stopped beneath it. It was a meager,
unpleasant light, too dim to be of any greater
use in the room than to afford the barest relief
from complete darkness. The window was
half overgrown with ivy, and he could see that
it was filthily dirty. The light continually
flickered, and once or twice it seemed to have
died out altogether. An eerie sensation began
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to possess him. He felt very strongly the evil
influence of the house. Curiosity to discover
what sinister secret it really harbored increased
and nerved him.</p>

<p>Again he tried to force a way through the
hedge, but everywhere it was an impassable
barrier. Slowly and noiselessly he worked his
way round the wing, only to find it completely
enclosed on all sides. He returned, and stood
looking up at the window. Either the light
was brighter, or the gap at the edge of the
blind had widened. He thought he saw a faint
shadow pass and re-pass.</p>

<p>It was not until, in moving to one side, he
struck his head against a massive bough of
one of the great trees that the possibility of
utilizing them as a means of access to the forbidden
enclosure occurred to him. He examined
the bough. It extended well over the
hedge, and would form a perfectly secure
bridge. By creeping a few feet along it, he
would be able to drop down on the other side
of the hedge. Finding the main trunk, he
tested his weight on a smaller bough, and
swung himself up into the tree.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
A few minutes later he stood within the barrier.
The window was some twelve or fifteen
feet above him. But the walls were thickly
clad with ivy, and ivy is an excellent ladder.
Carefully he began to climb.</p>

<p>He reached the window, found himself a
secure footing, and peered round the edge of
the blind. But the light was so poor, and the
panes were so dirty, on both sides, that had
there been anything to see he could have been
very little the wiser. As it was, the small area
of the room into which he could dimly peer
seemed to be carpetless and unfurnished.
There was no movement, no sound. The light
itself apparently came from the further end
of the room, from the level of a table. He
clung on, undecided how to proceed. It appeared
that the only thing to do was to wait and
listen for some indication of the purpose of the
dismal illumination.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was ten-thirty.
After a wait of what seemed at least half an
hour, he looked again. Ten minutes only had
passed. No discernible movement had taken
place in the room. Yet he felt perfectly, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
very unpleasantly, certain that it was occupied&mdash;that
something was proceeding within it
which, had the blind not intervened, would
have revealed the secret of the house. Of
what it might be he could form no idea&mdash;but,
for the first time in his life, he was experiencing,
in his mental tenseness and the sinister
silence of the surroundings, that sensation
which attests a proximity to evil. He was
daunted. Fear was a condition to which he
was a stranger, but a vivid nervousness was
beginning to seize upon him. A sense of personal
danger, an element which, so far, he had
scarcely considered, was attacking him, and
gaining ground. The perspiration was standing
out on his face. He found that his hands
were cold and wet. The pulses of his body
were throbbing; he felt his strength growing
less. Muttering a curse, he braced himself
with a strong effort. He was accustomed to
consider his nerves impregnable. Many times
in his life he had known himself to be in far
greater danger than he could attribute to the
present situation, and such weakness had never
assailed him. On four occasions he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
been aware that his life was hanging by a
thread, and had gloried in his own coolness.
And now ... without a doubt the Crooked
House was evil.</p>

<p>Still he waited. Another twenty minutes
slowly passed.</p>

<p>He started. His hands closed tightly on the
trunk of the ivy to which he was clinging.
The door of the room had been closed with a
slam. He could hear heavy footsteps on the
uncarpeted floor. A shadow blotted out the
light.</p>

<p>A moment later, a voice&mdash;a man's voice,
horribly strained and unnatural&mdash;rose in a
shout of fury.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" it screamed. "Look at your
work! Look at it again! Open your rotten
eyes and look! Look! Look!"</p>

<p>Tranter was so startled that he almost lost
his footing on the ivy. There was no mistaking
the voice&mdash;it was the scream of madness.
He listened for an answer, but there was no
sound in response. Then the same voice
laughed&mdash;a laugh of awful bitterness.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied? The thing is creeping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
on. I am getting nearer to you hour by hour.
I am more like you to-night. One more grain
went yesterday&mdash;another to-day. Another
will go to-morrow...." Again the voice rose
to a shriek of rage and hatred. "Oh, God!
There is no hope! No hope! Only on&mdash;and
on&mdash;to that!"</p>

<p>The words trailed off into a sob of agony.
Still Tranter could hear no reply.</p>

<p>Silence followed. The shadow again blotted
out the light; then sprang aside, and the voice
burst out into a fresh paroxysm of madness,
yelling a stream of curses at the object of its
fury. The madman's frenzy was utterly revolting
to listen to, but Tranter searched it
closely for some clue to the identity of the
person, or thing, to whom it was addressed.
The voice rose again to a shriek; then subsided
as before into a feeble wail of misery.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" it moaned&mdash;"is there no way
... no way? No road but that road? No
end but that end? Oh God, have mercy ...
have mercy...."</p>

<p>It was a cry of unspeakable anguish&mdash;the
prayer of a soul in torment. It seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Tranter that the speaker had thrown himself
down, and was beating the floor with his hands.</p>

<p>There was silence again. Then, for the first
time, Tranter became aware of another presence
in the room. Though he could neither
see nor hear anything, he was conscious of a
new, indefinable movement. For a moment
horror almost overcame him. He trembled.
His nerves failed. The support of the ivy
seemed to be giving way under him. He
clutched at the framework of the window itself.</p>

<p>The shadow of a figure leapt up from the
floor and bounded to the window. The blind
was wrenched aside, the window thrown open,
and before Tranter had time to recover himself
or attempt to escape, the livid, distorted face
of George Copplestone was almost touching
his own.</p>

<p>A hand closed on his throat in a murderous
grip, another seized his wrist. In spite of his
frantic struggles, he was dragged with superhuman
strength through the window into the
room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Duel</span></p>


<p>On the afternoon of the same day,
an hour after the departure of Inspector
Fay, Mrs. Astley-Rolfe had
sped herself to Richmond, in a
luxurious motor car, which was her's through
the instrumentality of Mr. Gluckstein.</p>

<p>She had found the house of George Copplestone
plunged into the darkness of a house of
mourning. Every blind was drawn. Every
particle of color had been removed or draped.
Black reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Copplestone was not pleased to see her, and
made no attempt to assume the contrary. He
was sitting in his library, moody and melancholy,
still in the half-dazed condition into
which the death of Christine Manderson had
cast him. His face was drawn, haggard, and
sickly; his eyes were bloodshot. He looked up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
at her with a forbidding frown, and did not
move from his chair.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said curtly.</p>

<p>She waved a hand round the black room.</p>

<p>"Isn't this ... a trifle theatrical?" she
asked coolly.</p>

<p>He said nothing. She sat down opposite to
him uninvited. She was perfectly self-possessed.</p>

<p>"Inspector Fay was kind enough to call on
me this morning," she remarked pleasantly.</p>

<p>Again there was no reply.</p>

<p>"He may not be an example of dagger-like
intelligence," she continued, looking at him
steadily&mdash;"but he is just a little too sharp to
play with."</p>

<p>He scowled at her.</p>

<p>"Have you come to tell me that?" he asked
rudely.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;and other things," she returned unruffled.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear them," he retorted.</p>

<p>"They concern you," she said&mdash;"rather
closely."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear them," he repeated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Her lips tightened.</p>

<p>"It is scarcely pleasant to be such an obviously
unwelcome visitor," she said evenly.
"But I am afraid you must listen."</p>

<p>"I am not in the humor to talk to you,"
he declared roughly. "I don't want to talk
to any one. I want to be left alone. Isn't
it enough to be pestered by the police and the
papers, and all the damnable business for the
inquest? Don't you see that my house is in
mourning? Can't you let me be&mdash;even for a
few days?"</p>

<p>"If I had let you be," she replied easily,
"Inspector Fay would probably be here in my
place&mdash;with much less pleasant intentions."</p>

<p>His glance sharpened.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he growled.</p>

<p>"You were not wise," she proceeded tranquilly,
"to treat his mental capabilities with
quite so much contempt. They are possibly
not startlingly brilliant, and he is perfectly easy
to deceive. But even an official detective can
see through a clumsy lie."</p>

<p>Uneasiness flashed across his face. She
smiled slightly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
"And I am afraid, my friend, that you are
a clumsy liar."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about,"
he snapped.</p>

<p>"Come," she said quietly&mdash;"however freely
we may trifle with the very much overrated
Arm of the Law, at least let us be honest with
each other. For some reason or other, you did
not tell Inspector Fay the truth."</p>

<p>He sat upright with a jerk, flamed with
passion.</p>

<p>"What the devil is it to do with you?" he
demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>"I will tell you in a moment," she returned
smoothly. "When you accounted for your
time to the inspector, you told him that you
went into the house to refill your cigarette
case?"</p>

<p>His lethargy had disappeared. He leant
forward, staring at her, his hands clutching
the arms of his chair.</p>

<p>"But, unfortunately, you did not take the
elementary precaution of having a full case
to support the story. In nine times out of ten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
you would have got away with it. This was
the tenth."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. She sat
in an easy attitude, meeting his gaze with complete
confidence. No trace of his previous
dullness remained. He was alert and taut.</p>

<p>She went on, with delightful smoothness.</p>

<p>"With an unpardonable lack of respect for
the statement of a gentleman, it occurred to the
inspector to test the truth of that account. He
did not want to smoke&mdash;but he asked you for a
cigarette. It was a gentle trap. There were
only two in your case."</p>

<p>He ground out an oath under his breath.</p>

<p>"Obviously you had not gone into the house
to refill your case. Perhaps you went in for
some other reason. Perhaps you didn't go in
at all. Anyway, you lied&mdash;and when people
deliberately lie in such serious cases as these, it
may safely be imagined that they have some
object to serve in doing so. The inspector was
concerned to discover what your object was.
So he came to me."</p>

<p>"To you...." he muttered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
"I told you," she returned, "that he is a little
too sharp to play with&mdash;clumsily. He suspected,
from what had been told him, that we
might have had a stormy scene together, and
had wished to keep it to ourselves. He was
quite ready to believe that the time you had
failed so lamentably to account for had really
been passed with me in '<i>une petite sc&egrave;ne de
jalousie</i>.' Fortunately, I had given him a true
account of myself, which was that I had been
alone. So after the necessary hesitation, and
with just the right amount of annoyance, I was
able to confess that we had both lied, and that
we had in fact been together&mdash;and he went
away satisfied. I am a better liar than
you."</p>

<p>She regarded him serenely. His expression
was ugly. There was that in the look of him
that might have daunted any woman, but
Phyllis Astley-Rolfe had lived chiefly by her
wits for a sufficient time to be quite impervious
where another would have been silenced. She
was as completely without fear as she was
without scruple. Her objects were objects to
be gained, by the most convenient and speedy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
means, and quite irrespective of considerations
which might have withheld another from attempting
to fulfill them. In furtherance of her
present object, she gave Copplestone look for
look.</p>

<p>"I return good for evil," she said. "It
is not a habit of mine. It is really quite contrary
to my usual practice. I told a lie to
save you from further suspicion. Considering
the circumstances, you must admit that it was
exceedingly generous of me. And I expect
you to be grateful."</p>

<p>Anything but an expression of gratitude confronted
her. He remained silent, making a
strong effort to mask his agitation. But his
fingers twitched spasmodically, and there was
unmistakable fear in his eyes. She watched
him intently, losing no point of the effect she
had created.</p>

<p>"Well...?" she said steadily.</p>

<p>There was no answer. She bent towards
him.</p>

<p>"I said you were with me. You were not
with me. Where were you?"</p>

<p>The man breathed heavily, his baleful gaze
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
fixed on her. She met it with unassailable
composure.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said slowly&mdash;"there are strange
things in this house. I know it. I've known
it for some time. Things that the light of day
never shines on. What are they?"</p>

<p>He sprang up, and stood over her with
clenched hands, his face torn with fury.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he cried hoarsely. "What is
my house, or what happens in it, to you?"</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said firmly. "You are not
frightening me. To threaten a woman is
merely to increase her tenacity, and mine requires
no fortification. Please move away
from me."</p>

<p>He obeyed, muttering. Her calmness disarmed
him.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," she continued, "that I
wanted you to answer my question&mdash;anyway
at present. Perhaps your secrets might be too
much, even for my conscience&mdash;and that is saying
a great deal."</p>

<p>He had resumed his chair. There was a moment's
pause.</p>

<p>"You were foolish to mock me," she went on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
"Mockery is the one thing a woman cannot
accept, or forgive. She can stand any amount
of ill-treatment and cruelty, in a sufficient cause.
But she cannot be mocked in any cause whatever.
You made me certain promises, which
honor bound you to fulfil&mdash;and then flung your
renunciation of them in my face, before
strangers who understood. It was a very
mean and low-down thing to do."</p>

<p>A faint, sneering smile passed over his face.
Her voice hardened.</p>

<p>"I am not a woman to defy&mdash;and I am still
less a woman to mock. You are going to keep
your promises."</p>

<p>"I'll see you in hell first!" he retorted
brutally.</p>

<p>She laughed. "You will not see me in hell
first," she said calmly. "You may quite possibly
see me in hell after&mdash;because if there is
a hell we shall certainly meet there. But in
the meantime&mdash;you are going to redeem your
word."</p>

<p>He made a slow gesture round the black
room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
"You come to me now ... within a few
hours...."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she returned hardly.</p>

<p>"Almost before her body is cold...."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Christine Manderson was an incident," she
said indifferently. "A disagreeable episode.
She merely infatuated you, as she might have
infatuated any man. She has passed."</p>

<p>"Passed," he muttered. "Passed...."</p>

<p>"I do not profess to equal her in appearance,"
she admitted. "But I am not repulsive.
I am considered to be extremely good-looking,
and I am much more interesting to talk to than
she was. Also, I am well-bred. Most people
would find the balance in my favor. But, even
if you do not, the difference can only be very
small. You will have to make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Or else?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Or else, if you prefer it, I will exchange
your promises for the secrets of this house&mdash;with
no undertaking to keep them."</p>

<p>He sat biting his nails in the suppression of
his rage. She languidly corrected the folds of
her dress, leant back in a charming attitude,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
and waited with unassailable self-possession.
The silence was long.</p>

<p>"How much do you want?" he demanded,
at last.</p>

<p>"I am not asking you for money," she replied
coldly.</p>

<p>"I am offering it unasked," he retorted.
"How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"If you had offered to buy back your promises
a week ago," she said, "I might have sold
them to you. I do not know that I particularly
looked forward to their fulfilment. But you
flaunted another woman in my face."</p>

<p>"Put it all in the bill," he said coarsely.</p>

<p>"Therefore I will give you nothing back.
You shall have only your bond."</p>

<p>"Why waste your breath on heroics to me?"
he sneered. "You would sell your soul for
money. You have often boasted it."</p>

<p>"I would sell my soul for money any day,"
she agreed frankly&mdash;"but not my pride. I am
too much of a sinner already to scruple over the
disposal of my soul. But it would not profit
me to gain the whole world, and lose my pride."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" he said contemptuously. "Pride
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
pays no bills&mdash;and you owe too many to let it
deprive you of the pleasure of getting rid of
a few."</p>

<p>"That is as it may be," she returned. "I
have told you the only exchange I will make."</p>

<p>He sprang up again. This time his anger
was scornful.</p>

<p>"Fool!" he cried harshly. "Take your
warning! Do you think my secrets&mdash;if I have
any&mdash;are for you? Or that I, myself, am for
you? Why do you try to force yourself on to
dangerous ground? There are things in the
world into which it is not good to pry."</p>

<p>"Plenty," she said, unmoved.</p>

<p>"I may have made you careless promises,"
he admitted. "I have made many women
promises. It is a bad habit. I cannot keep
them. I cannot, and will not, marry you, or
any other woman. The only one I might have
married ... is dead."</p>

<p>"Again you throw her in my face," she
murmured, through closed teeth.</p>

<p>"I daresay I used you meanly," he acknowledged.
"I <i>did</i> use you meanly. It was not
the game to do what I did that night. I freely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
admit it. And I offer you reparation&mdash;the
only reparation I can make. It would be the
wisest act of your life to take it."</p>

<p>"You have heard my conditions," she replied.
"I shall not change them. Unlike most
women, I have been gifted with the faculty of
being able to make up my mind. The time for
compromise has passed."</p>

<p>"You don't care for me," he persisted.
"You couldn't care for any man. You're not
capable of it. It's not in you."</p>

<p>"Whether or not I care for you does not enter
into the matter at all," she rejoined calmly.
"My capability for affection has no bearing
on the present question."</p>

<p>"You were relying on marrying me to pay
your debts," he declared. "You could not have
built a more forlorn hope. I should not pay
your debts if I did marry you. I will give you
five thousand pounds for your lie this morning."</p>

<p>She was very angry. The insult dashed all
the color from her face, leaving it white and
set in lines that made her look almost old.
Her eyes glittered menacingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
"You dare," she said slowly, "to offer <i>me</i>
five thousand pounds?"</p>

<p>"And consider yourself damned lucky!"
he retorted.</p>

<p>He took out his case, and lit a cigarette
with a show of indifference.</p>

<p>"I am not bound to offer you anything," he
said carelessly. "That small point seems to
have escaped you. You have no claim on me.
I consider my suggestion an exceedingly generous
one. You can take it or leave it. It's
all you'll get."</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p>"You insult me again," she said, in measured
tones. "You are not wise."</p>

<p>He laughed easily.</p>

<p>"My dear Phyllis," he said, "you are adorable
in a rage&mdash;but I am afraid I must steel
myself against your gentle exactions. Let me
convince you that I am really treating you in
a highly preferential manner. During my
career three women have attempted to blackmail
me. They were all ugly&mdash;so they got
nothing. You are charming&mdash;so you get five
thousand pounds. That is the most I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
ever paid for my smaller indiscretions. And
I take the liberty of thinking it more than sufficient
compensation for the few erroneous impressions
I may have allowed you to contract."</p>

<p>"You are making the mistake," she said,
in the same controlled tones, "of imagining
that you are buying back your promises to me,
which I can quite understand that you value
lightly. But I have told you that those promises
are not for sale. You have wandered
from the real issue. You are not buying the
promises of your heart&mdash;you are buying the
secrets of your house. Are they not on a different
scale of values?"</p>

<p>"You know nothing of my house," he returned.
"You do not know whether there are
secrets in it or not."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she confessed candidly.
"Possibly there are not. But I am prepared
to take a sporting chance that there are. And
if I am wrong&mdash;so much the better for you."</p>

<p>He was silent, looking at her thoughtfully,
as if carefully weighing his course of action.</p>

<p>"You were under the suspicion of Scotland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Yard," she reminded him, "until I told my
lie. You will be under it again if I admit my
lie. Inspector Fay would certainly not rest
until he had thoroughly investigated your reasons
for giving a false account of yourself.
He is by no means a fool&mdash;and I very much
doubt that he is to be bought, anyway so reasonably
as I am."</p>

<p>Copplestone's face wore a strange expression.
There was now no animosity in it, but
rather a mild resignation, in strange contrast
to his previous anger.</p>

<p>"So," he said, after a pause, "you would
put them on to me again...?"</p>

<p>"I need not have taken them off you," she
replied.</p>

<p>"I have offered you five thousand pounds
for that," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"I have refused them."</p>

<p>"Think over it well," he advised her impressively.</p>

<p>"I do not need to," she returned.</p>

<p>For a moment they faced each other steadily.</p>

<p>"You mean that&mdash;finally?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Finally," she answered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
He moved to a door at the further end of
the room, and opened it.</p>

<p>"Come," he said quietly. "You have gone
too far to draw back. You shall see the secrets
of my house. Follow me."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Secret of the House</span></p>


<p>She followed him out of the black room
into a dark, narrow passage.</p>

<p>Her calmness and self-possession
remained undisturbed. Without a
tremor she accepted this unexpected invitation
to the secrets of the Crooked House&mdash;quite
ignorant of, and indifferent to, the danger to
which she might be committing herself. That
there were hidden things in the house she had
for a long time been convinced, but of their
nature she had been unable to form even a conjecture,
in spite of many attempts to creep into
the mystery. Copplestone's sudden decision
to reveal them to her was a surprise, and an
unpleasant check to the development of her
schemes. Either he placed a much lower
value on his secrets than she had expected, or
her participation in them was by no means to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
be dreaded to the extent that she had relied
upon. In any case her position was considerably
weakened, and the success of her plans
was no longer the assured thing she had believed
it to be.</p>

<p>In silence they ascended a flight of stairs,
and reached a door which appeared to be the
entrance into a separate part of the building.
It was a massive oak door, fitted with double
locks of remarkable strength for a private
house. Copplestone held it open, motioning
her to pass before him, and relocked it on the
other side. She was still without any nervousness,
but her curiosity increased with every
step. He led the way on, and she followed
him unhesitatingly. They traversed several
corridors, and turned many corners. Her
sense of direction told her that they had
entered an extreme wing of the house, hidden
away among the thickest trees of the garden,
and to all appearances unused. The place
was damp, dusty, and silent, with the intense
silence of emptiness. Some of the doors were
open, showing unfurnished, neglected rooms.
The papers were peeling off the walls; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
fittings were covered with the rust and dirt
of years; the soiled blinds half covered the
closed, uncleaned windows. The atmosphere
was close and unhealthy.</p>

<p>"What a parable of waste!" she said.</p>

<p>He did not reply. They came to a square
landing, and another heavy door faced them.
Copplestone stopped, and for a moment stood
looking at her intently. She did not flinch.
He shrugged his shoulders, and took a key
from his pocket. It was a peculiar key, and
was attached to a strong chain. He fitted it
into the lock, and opened the door. Then he
turned to her again, and she saw a change
coming over his face.</p>

<p>"Go in," he said curtly.</p>

<p>She hesitated, for the first time. He
withdrew the key, and returned it to his
pocket.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid," he said.</p>

<p>"I will follow you," she returned, watching
him carefully.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders again, and went
into the room. She entered after him.</p>

<p>It was a long, low room. There was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
window at the far end, but it was so dirty, and
the curtains in front of it were so thick and
discolored, that the place was in semi-darkness,
and the air overwhelmingly heavy and unwholesome.
There was a little rough furniture,
a strip of worn carpet on the floor, and
some untasted food on the table&mdash;but it was not
any of those dismal objects that attached the
woman's gaze. It was rather a white, pasty
face that seemed to gleam at her from the
darkest corner of the room&mdash;the drawn pallid
face, and dull lifeless eyes, of a white-haired
man, who was sitting in a huddled, contorted
attitude on a bare wooden chair.</p>

<p>She shrank back with a startled exclamation,
and turned to Copplestone. His face was
convulsed with fury, his eyes aflame with
hatred.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said harshly.</p>

<p>She drew away from him fearfully.</p>

<p>"What wickedness is this?" she shuddered.</p>

<p>"None of mine," he answered.</p>

<p>The vacant eyes rested on them with a fixed
stare, completely devoid of intelligence. The
huddled figure evinced no sign of life. It appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to be unconscious of their presence.
Copplestone advanced a few paces; but the
woman hung back, horrified.</p>

<p>"Is that ... a living thing?" she whispered.</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;an unnatural, metallic laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said&mdash;"it's living ... with as
much life as its sins have left it, and its rotten
body can hold."</p>

<p>He turned back to her.</p>

<p>"Come nearer," he said. "There is nothing
to be afraid of."</p>

<p>But the glassy stare of the motionless figure
had unnerved her. She was white, and shaking.</p>

<p>"No, no," she muttered, shrinking further
back.</p>

<p>He seized her arm.</p>

<p>"I warned you," he cried roughly, "but you
wouldn't listen. You were brave enough then&mdash;when
you thought I daren't stand up to you.
You shall learn your lesson&mdash;you who talked
so glibly of my secrets. Come closer."</p>

<p>He dragged her with him towards the
corner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
"Look!" he commanded. "Look at that
thing in front of you&mdash;that thing crouching
there like an ape. It was once a man. It was
once an active, intelligent, healthy human being&mdash;a
strong handsome member of a strong
handsome family. Everything was in its
favor. There were no obstacles in its path.
It had many more natural gifts than the average
man is endowed with. It might have
ruled an empire. It might have loaded its
name with honor, and left it to its children. It
had the capability, the power, and the opportunity
to leave the world a better place than it
found it. Look at it now."</p>

<p>She stood silent, her head turned away. He
went on, with increasing rage.</p>

<p>"Look at that man now! He has brought
himself to a state of gibbering insanity by a
life of indulgence in every form of vice and
depravity known to humanity. He knowingly
and deliberately drained his mental and
physical resources by every insult to nature
that depraved men and women&mdash;the lowest
creatures of the earth&mdash;have devised for the
satisfaction of their diseased senses. He was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a drunkard and drug-fiend before he was
twenty. Every effort was made to check and
reclaim him, but he defied them all. He was
fully warned. He knew what the consequences
would be. He knew that nature cannot
be violated continuously without exacting
her penalty, sooner or later. But he plunged
on. Step by step he brought himself to this.
His brain and his body are decaying from the
unnameable excesses he has committed with
both. He is literally rotting in front of us at
this moment."</p>

<p>She put her hands up to her face.</p>

<p>"Can he hear you?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied savagely. "Perhaps
he can. I hope he can. I hope he can
hear every word. It wouldn't be the first time
he had heard the story of his shame. And it
won't be the last. Curse him!"</p>

<p>She tried to draw him back.</p>

<p>"Come away," she cried. "How can you
stand in front of the poor creature, and talk
like that before his face?"</p>

<p>His iron grip closed on her wrist, and held
her helpless.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
"Why not?" he demanded, with dreadful
bitterness. "Why should he be spared because
he is suffering a fraction of the just and
natural consequences of his own deliberate
acts? What is there to pity in that? It is a
merciful retribution. If you have any sympathy
to show&mdash;show it to me."</p>

<p>"To you?" she echoed.</p>

<p>"To me," he repeated.</p>

<p>She screamed, and tried to wrench herself
from his grasp. The horrible head had begun
to move slowly from side to side. A faint,
ghastly smile appeared round the twisted
lips.</p>

<p>"Let me go," she cried. "It's too dreadful."</p>

<p>He dragged her round again.</p>

<p>"You forced yourself into my secrets," he
said hardly. "It is too late to shrink back
now. You shall know them to the full&mdash;and
then you may go."</p>

<p>He paused, still holding her. In her horror,
and under the sickly, stifling atmosphere of the
room, she was almost fainting. But he paid
no heed to her condition. His eyes were fixed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
malignantly on the grinning object of his
hatred.</p>

<p>"That man," he said slowly, "was free from
any hereditary weakness. His viciousness
was not inherent. He came of a good, clean
stock. When he was thirty&mdash;although the inevitable
results of his violations had already
seized upon him&mdash;he committed the crime of
marrying. It was the foulest sin of his life.
He knew what the result would be&mdash;what it
was bound by every natural law to be. He
knew that the sins of the fathers must be visited
on the children"&mdash;he clenched his hands,
and she winced as her wrist was crushed in
his grip&mdash;"and knowing that, he dared to
marry."</p>

<p>His voice rose. His face began to work
with passion.</p>

<p>"He married a good woman&mdash;who bore all
the cruelties he heaped upon her because she
loved him. Her money had been his only consideration&mdash;and
when he had got all that he treated her like dirt. But there are
limits even to what a woman can bear. He broke her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
heart, and she died ... mad. If only she
had died a little sooner...."</p>

<p>She steadied herself with an effort.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" she asked. "Why is he here,
in your house?"</p>

<p>A flood of fury shook him.</p>

<p>"His name is Oscar Winslowe," he said
fiercely. "He is my father."</p>

<p>She uttered a sharp cry, and wrenched her
hand away from him.</p>

<p>"Your father? That creature ... your
father...."</p>

<p>"Yes," he cried wildly&mdash;"he is my father.
I am George Copplestone Winslowe. Do you
wonder that I hate him? I am the victim of
his vices&mdash;the heir to his sins. He has left
me the legacy of outraged nature. I am mad."</p>

<p>She recoiled from him, panting. He was
beside himself. His face was distorted; madness
glared in his eyes. Then, suddenly, the
paroxysm left him. He turned to her weakly,
with the appeal of his utter despair.</p>

<p>"Pity me," he said. "Oh, if you are capable
of pitying anything in this dreadful world,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
pity me! My awful inheritance is closing in
on me. Every day one more grain of reason
leaves me. Like him, I might have been a
leader of men. Like him, I have power and
capability. I have a brain that could have
raised me to the greatest heights. I have a
body that can bear any strain. But I am
mad."</p>

<p>His agony was pitiful. He sobbed, wringing
his hands.</p>

<p>"I can feel the hideous thing growing in
me, hour by hour&mdash;a little more&mdash;a little more.
I can feel its clutch tightening on me. And
I can't resist. I can't escape. The little mental
balance I have is being dragged away from
me. In a few years&mdash;if I let myself live to
it&mdash;I shall be a babbling maniac. Nothing
can save me. I knew it when I was a boy&mdash;before
that thing there completely lost its reason.
I knew I was born a madman for my father's
sins. It crept on me gradually&mdash;one sign after
another&mdash;one horrible secret impulse after another.
The slow, sure growth of madness."
He buried his face in his hands. "Oh, God!
Oh, God!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
In the silence that followed the figure on
the chair straightened itself with a jerk, and
gibbered at him, twitching spasmodically.
The woman turned away, shaking.</p>

<p>"I live in hell," he moaned&mdash;"in all the torment
of the uttermost hell. I fly from one
thing to another for respite, for relief&mdash;but
there is no relief. I can only make madness of
them all. Everything twists and turns in my
hands. I can keep nothing straight." Then
another gust of passion seized him. He
shouted, beating his hands together. "What
right," he cried furiously, "have men and
women to marry and bequeath disease and madness
to their children? What right have they
to propagate the rottenness of their minds and
bodies? It's worse than murder. It's the
cruelest, the most wicked, of all crimes. What
are the feelings of a child to such parents?
Is it not to hate them&mdash;as I hate that foul thing
there?&mdash;to curse them, as I curse him, with
every breath?" His arms dropped limply to
his sides. "What is the use of hating?" he
said dully. "It can't cure me. It can't cure
me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
He looked at her fixedly.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked bitterly. "You know the
secrets of my house. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>She laid a hand on his arm, and turned him
gently towards the door. There were tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Come away," she said weakly. "Let us
speak somewhere else."</p>

<p>He followed her. They went out, without
another look at the figure behind them, and
returned in silence to the black room.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Truer Colors</span></p>


<p>A great change had come over her.
All the hardness had disappeared
from her face. It was transformed
by a wonderful new pity&mdash;a latent
compassion, stirred for the first time by this
miserable man's utter tragedy. And so transformed
she was very lovely&mdash;with a loveliness
that all the arts of an accomplished society
woman had never bestowed upon her.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," she said gently. "I would
not have said what I did if I had even thought
... of that."</p>

<p>He looked down at her, a world of agony in
his tortured eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked&mdash;"do you still want to
marry me ... now?"</p>

<p>For an instant the old hardness flashed
back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
"You would have married <i>her</i>," she returned.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said slowly. "I wonder
... if I should."</p>

<p>His gaze wandered vacantly round the room.</p>

<p>"She intoxicated me," he said. "Her
memory intoxicates me still. She set fire to
all my passions. She made me forget the barrier.
But I think I really hated her. Perhaps
... if she hadn't died in the garden
... I might have killed her...."</p>

<p>The madness was leaving him, and the
weakness of reaction taking its place. He put
a hand on her shoulder, and leant heavily on
her. His face was mild and kind&mdash;the face
of the normal man.</p>

<p>"Phyllis," he said softly, "I mocked you, and
treated you badly. But it wasn't really I.
Forgive a poor madman the sins of his madness."</p>

<p>She made no attempt to check her tears.
He took her hand, as gently as a child.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," he begged. "See&mdash;I am all
right now. Sit down, and let us talk."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Still leaning on her, he moved to a couch,
and drew her down beside him.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "I will tell you why I lied
to Inspector Fay. I did not go into the house
to fill my cigarette case. I was mad. It came
on me&mdash;as it often does&mdash;when I see sane people
about me&mdash;a rush of hatred and despair."</p>

<p>He spoke dispassionately, without a trace
of the terrible disorder that had possessed him
a few minutes before. Only the gloom remained&mdash;the
shadow that never left him.</p>

<p>"You can understand," he went on, "what
my life has been since this cloud first settled
on me. I tried to fight against it&mdash;but how
could I fight against a thing that I knew to be
there, creeping on me day after day&mdash;when
I knew that in the end I must give way?
Every hour seemed to bring some fresh proof
of the madness that was in me&mdash;some proof
that made resistance more and more futile and
hopeless. A thousand times I have been
tempted to kill myself&mdash;but always there was
the dim, desperate hope that some miraculous
twist of sanity might yet deliver me. I can't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
convey to you a tenth&mdash;a hundredth&mdash;part of
the agony of that struggle. There were times
when I shrank into the farthest corner of my
darkest cellar, and prayed, as only a madman
could pray, to be spared from the unjust curse.
There were times when I stood out on the roof
of my house, and defied the God I had prayed
to...."</p>

<p>He stared straight out in front of him, a
figure of unutterable pathos&mdash;a helpless accuser
of Eternal Laws.</p>

<p>"If I were suffering for a fault of my own,
I would bear my punishment uncomplaining.
But I am innocent. I have done nothing to
deserve this torture. And there is always the
thought of what I might have been&mdash;of what
I know I could have been. That is the cruelest
torment of all. I have to see sane men
and women wasting every minute of their lives&mdash;without
the slightest appreciation of the
value, or the responsibilities, of reason&mdash;who
might as well be mad, for all the use they are
to their fellow-creatures. And I...." He
broke off. "That is enough about myself," he
said. "I want to talk about you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
He looked at her in surprise, as if noticing
the alteration in her for the first time.</p>

<p>"How changed you are," he said. "You
have never looked like that before. You have
always been so hard. Why have you never
looked like that before?"</p>

<p>She was silent. She bent her head, as if
ashamed of betraying herself.</p>

<p>"Was all that hardness ... only a cloak
... to hide yourself?"</p>

<p>He seized her hand tightly.</p>

<p>"You fool! You fool!" he cried&mdash;"to make
yourself hard and unfeeling and unnatural&mdash;to
try to stamp all the heart out of your life&mdash;to
blaspheme your sex. Don't you know that
a hard woman is the most terrible thing in the
world? Don't you know that while men dare
to think that they have the image of God, it is
women who can really have the heart of God?
And to think that all the time you have disguised
yourself, you have been capable of looking
like that."</p>

<p>"I have been up against the world," she
said. "I have never had enough money to be
soft-hearted. No woman with feeling can get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
five hundred per cent. out of her income."</p>

<p>"What does it matter," he returned, "if she
can get five hundred per cent. out of life?"</p>

<p>He still held her hand, his eyes fixed longingly
on her face.</p>

<p>"If only I were not mad," he said, with all
his sadness&mdash;"now I know that you are really
a woman...."</p>

<p>"Let me go," she said brokenly, withdrawing
her hand from his.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he returned, detaining her.
"There is something more I want to do." He
paused. "My dear," he said softly, "an hour
ago I would not have married you even if I had
been sane. Now I want to marry you although
I am mad. But, since that cannot be, there is
something else." He released her, and stood
up. "I want you always to look like that," he
said. "I want you to forget that you have ever
tried to disguise yourself. I want to make it
possible for you to go through the rest of your
life with your heart in its proper place."</p>

<p>He took his check book from his pocket.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said quickly&mdash;"not that."</p>

<p>"Please," he insisted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
"I would have taken it before," she said,
forcing back her tears. "But not now."</p>

<p>"You must," he declared. "My money is
no use to me. I can't do anything worth doing
with it. With all my fantastic extravagancies,
I only spend a small part of my income.
The rest has been accumulating for
years. I shall never use it, and when I die
it will pass to some one I have never seen. It
is doing no good&mdash;and I want it to do some
good. What better thing could I do with it
than give it ... to the woman I would marry
if I could?"</p>

<p>She sprang up.</p>

<p>"For God's sake," she cried, "don't say that!
I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>He laid a hand again on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you care?" he asked slowly. "I don't
think you cared before. I thought you were
only sorry for me now. Do you really care?"</p>

<p>"I do care!" she cried recklessly. "I care&mdash;and
care&mdash;and care. My God, how I
care!"</p>

<p>He turned his face upwards, and over it
passed a dreadful, mocking smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
"O God of Mercy!" he muttered&mdash;"another
torment!"</p>

<p>He drew away from her.</p>

<p>"I shall do this for you," he said firmly.
"I intend to do this. And then we must not
see each other again. I hope that when you
marry, as you must, you will marry a good,
clean man&mdash;a man who can stand out among
his fellow-creatures, and need not shrink away
from them, as I must. I want you to be very
happy and bring happy children to the world...."
His voice shook. "And forget there
are unfortunate people in it ... who may
only gaze hungrily over the gulf that they can
never cross."</p>

<p>He left her sobbing, and went to his writing
table.</p>

<p>"No one will know," he said. "I will draw
it to myself. The bank is quite close here. I
will walk there and cash it at once."</p>

<p>He wrote the check, and rose.</p>

<p>"Wait for me here," he said. "I shall only
be a few minutes." And he went out with the
face of a stricken man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Providing for the Worst</span></p>


<p>Though Inspector Fay had disclosed
no more than was necessary for the
purpose of the initial charge, the arrest
of James Layton was popularly
considered to have solved the mystery of the
murder of Christine Manderson.</p>

<p>No one realized more fully than Layton himself
the overwhelming strength of the case
against him. He was as good as condemned
already. Beyond his own assertion of innocence,
he was utterly defenseless against a
sequence of evidence that might well have shattered
the strongest reply. And he was without
any reply at all, except his own denial. He
could only admit the truth of the damning
train of circumstances, in face of which his
mere word was hopelessly&mdash;and, he was compelled
to acknowledge, justly&mdash;inadequate.
The secret of his identity&mdash;most crushing fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of all&mdash;was lost. He was the Michael Cranbourne
whom Christine Manderson, then Thea
Colville, had drawn on to ruin and disgrace.
He had threatened her, in the presence of
witness, with just such an end as she had met
with. He had been seen lurking in the garden
at the time of the crime. He had been beside
himself. And to all that he had no more convincing
answer than the plea of not guilty.
He placed himself, quite dispassionately, in
the position of his own judge and jury. There
could be only one result.</p>

<p>The strange message of hope, brought to him
by Jenny West, from a mysterious foreigner
who had declared knowledge of his innocence
and of half the truth, aroused his curiosity, if
no more. That one person, at all events, had
discovered, and was apparently pursuing, an
alternative to his own guilt was interesting,
if a slender encouragement to build on. He
was not disposed to cling to flimsy hopes. He
accepted his position with perfect calmness.
Since the confession of his identity to Inspector
Fay a load seemed to have been lifted from
his mind, and with it had passed the revival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of mad passion which the sight of Christine
Manderson's fatal beauty had aroused. He
found himself able to dwell on her memory&mdash;even
to contemplate her death&mdash;with a cold detachment
which surprised himself. He no
longer shrank from conjuring up her image&mdash;but
now it was a dead image from a dead
world. And&mdash;not without surprise also, and
perhaps a certain satisfaction&mdash;he found himself
looking forward to a visit from Jenny
West.</p>

<p>She came to him at the appointed time. She
was very white. The deep shadows of sleepless
grief and anxiety were round her eyes&mdash;but
in them shone the fire of a dogged, dauntless
courage. Her great untamed soul was
aflame with revolt against the implacable circumstances
that had placed the man whose
name a thousand had blessed on the highroad
to the gallows. She threw herself against the
wall of facts with all the force of her primitive
love. She was one of those whose trust rises
to its greatest heights when opposed to reason.</p>

<p>He greeted her kindly. He was cheerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and composed. He showed that he was glad
to see her.</p>

<p>"We shall save you, Jim!" she declared,
straining back the tears that sprang to her
eyes at his kindness. "I know we shall! I
know it!"</p>

<p>"God will save His workman," he returned
quietly&mdash;"if it is His will."</p>

<p>He looked at her closely. And something
very like affection came into his face.</p>

<p>"You are pale," he said. "You are over
strained. You haven't slept."</p>

<p>She bent her head, to hide her brimming
eyes.</p>

<p>"My child...." he said gently.</p>

<p>"What does it matter," she sobbed, "if I
haven't slept? How can I sleep&mdash;when you
are ... here?"</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear," he said&mdash;"we must face
this thing squarely. It's no use trying to shut
our eyes to the truth, however unpleasant it
may be. As the case stands at present, no
jury in the world could acquit me. I have
no reply to the charge, except to declare that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
I did not kill Christine Manderson&mdash;and that
will not help me. The evidence is more than
enough to satisfy any impartial, clear-thinking
man or woman. It would satisfy me.
That I know myself to be innocent will not assist
me to establish my innocence. Thousands
of things may happen in the meantime&mdash;but I
must prepare to suffer the penalty for a crime
that I did not commit."</p>

<p>"You shall not!" she cried passionately.
"If there is justice in heaven or earth, you
shall not!"</p>

<p>"I do not cling to life," he returned. "It
has very little to give me, or to take away.
Men may find me guilty&mdash;but I shall stand
before God innocent. It will not be the first
time I have stood before God."</p>

<p>A spark of his old fanaticism flashed into
his eyes for a moment, then faded.</p>

<p>"I shall be ready," he said steadily, "for
whatever He sends."</p>

<p>"Men shall not find you guilty," she declared.
"There are three people working for
you. The truth will be discovered."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
"Your mysterious Frenchman?" he smiled.
"What has he done?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she confessed. "He tells
me nothing&mdash;except to keep on promising that
you will be saved. And that is enough for
me."</p>

<p>A frown darkened Layton's face.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not put yourself so completely
into the hands of a stranger," he said
doubtfully. "Who and what, is this man?
And how does he come to be mixed up in this
affair?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing whatever about him," she
replied. "But there is something that makes
me trust him. I believe he will keep his
promise."</p>

<p>"I don't like it," he insisted.</p>

<p>"If I didn't help him," she said, "I could
do nothing. And I should go mad."</p>

<p>"What has he given you to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I promised not to tell any one," she hesitated.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You had better tell me. You have no one
else to protect you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
"It is something I can't understand," she
said slowly. "This morning I had to write
out the names and addresses of all the Art and
Picture Dealers from the <i>Directory</i>, and this
afternoon I am to go round in a car to as many
of them as I can, with a letter from the French
Embassy, to ask if any articles have ever been
supplied to, or orders taken from, a Miss
Masters, of 35, De Vere Terrace, Streatham,
and if so, what."</p>

<p>Layton stared at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What possible connection can that have
with the case?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said again. "I've tried
to think."</p>

<p>"The French Embassy," he mused. "That
is strange...."</p>

<p>He checked himself, and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"You time is nearly up," he said. "Listen
to me carefully. There is one very important
thing that I want you to understand. Whatever
may develop in the meantime, I intend
to prepare for the worst."</p>

<p>He kept her silent with a firm gesture.</p>

<p>"My work must go on. No matter what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
happens to me, my work must go on. And
it must be carried on as I have begun it, by
some one who has worked with me, and understands
my objects&mdash;by some one who is human,
and unlimited by sect or creed. I don't want
to make people religious&mdash;it would spoil most
of them. I want to make them healthy and
happy. I would rather they were clean pagans
than unclean Christians. No soul is saved or
lost because it happens to take a certain view
of the Mysteries of God. It is the bodies I
care for&mdash;the bodies I want to build. Humanity
should be a song of thanksgiving, not
a prayer for alleviation."</p>

<p>The fires kindled again. His face was lit
up.</p>

<p>"You must continue my work. If I should
have to leave it ... you will find everything
yours. There is over a million. Use it as
I have taught you. Use it to help children
to grow into men and women, and men and
women to grow into old men and women. Use
it to help human beings against the cruelties
they inflict on each other&mdash;and animals against
the cruelties inflicted on them. Promise me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
that if the worst happens, you will go on where
I leave off."</p>

<p>Tears blinded her. She could not speak.</p>

<p>"Promise," he insisted.</p>

<p>"I will," she sobbed. "I will go on&mdash;as long
as I can live after you."</p>

<p>He stood still, looking at her fixedly. There
was the dawn of an awakening on his face.</p>

<p>"My God!" he whispered, "I was wrong.
I do cling to life. I want to live. O God,
save me!"</p>

<p>And the girl uttered a great sigh of thankfulness,
and fell fainting against the wire partition
that stood between them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Disappearance of Tranter</span></p>


<p>At one o'clock on the following day,
Monsieur Dupont sat in his room
waiting for Tranter. At half-past
one he had become impatient. At
two he seized the telephone directory, and, a
minute later, the instrument. At two-thirty
he obtained his number.</p>

<p>The answer to his first question stiffened
him into an attitude of rigid tensity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tranter is not in, sir," a voice told
him. "He has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Disappeared?" Monsieur Dupont echoed
sharply.</p>

<p>"We do not know what has happened to
him. He went out last night at nine o'clock,
and has not returned."</p>

<p>"Not returned...." the listener muttered.</p>

<p>"We are getting anxious," the voice went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
on. "He left orders for his supper, and there
is no doubt that he intended to return. We
have telephoned to the hospitals and the police
stations, but nothing has been heard of him.
Do you happen to know where he was going?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Monsieur
Dupont's hands were clenched so tightly round
the instrument that the veins stood out on
them like cords.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly, "I know where he
was going."</p>

<p>He rose quickly.</p>

<p>"I will find him," he promised and rang
off.</p>

<p>He replaced the instrument, and stood still.
For the first time since his arrival in London
fear found a place in the expression of his
face.</p>

<p>"<i>Dieu</i>," he whispered&mdash;"that Crooked
House...."</p>

<p>He seized his hat and stick, and hurried out
to his car.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Remarkable changes were in progress when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
he arrived at the Crooked House. A small
army of workmen swarmed over the whole
place in a condition of feverish energy. There
were stacks of tools, dozens of machines, and
cartloads of material. At first sight it might
have appeared as if nothing less than the effects
of an earthquake could have been in process
of repair&mdash;but, as Monsieur Dupont stood
staring about him in amazement, it became apparent
that the men were engaged in eliminating
the crookedness of the garden, and must
have been so engaged from a very early hour.
Many of the twisting paths had been shorn of
their high maze-like walls of hedge, and the
paths themselves were in varying stages of conversion
or disappearance. Under rapid and
ruthless hands straightness was already appearing
out of the confusion. Monsieur Dupont
looked positively frightened.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," he exclaimed aloud, "they are
making it a human garden!"</p>

<p>The house itself presented a no less startling
aspect. It was no longer gloomy, deserted,
and silent. It was teeming with life. Every
window was open, and from within came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
sounds of rapacious cleaning. A hundred
painters had commenced a vigorous assault
upon the exterior, and representatives of every
branch of house decoration were attacking the
interior. It was a scene of resurrection.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont almost ran to the open
front door. Copplestone's manservant was at
work in the hall, and came forward with a
sphinx-like expression.</p>

<p>"Mr. Copplestone?" said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"Mr. Copplestone is away, sir."</p>

<p>"Away...?"</p>

<p>"He left in the car early this morning, sir,
without saying where he was going or when he
would be back."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont was plainly staggered.</p>

<p>"Was he alone?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir."</p>

<p>"You do not know?"</p>

<p>"I did not see him leave, sir. He gave me
my instructions in the library, and ordered me
to remain there until he had gone."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont took a threatening step
towards him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
"Where is Mr. Tranter?" he demanded,
with sudden fierceness.</p>

<p>The man met his challenging gaze steadily.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tranter, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tranter came here last night&mdash;between
ten and eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"I think you must be mistaken, sir. If he
had come here, I should have seen him."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont clenched his fists.</p>

<p>"I am not mistaken! I say that he came
here last night!"</p>

<p>"I did not see him, sir."</p>

<p>"Since then he has disappeared. He has
not returned to his house, and nothing has been
heard of him. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing of Mr. Tranter, sir."</p>

<p>"That is not true!" Monsieur Dupont almost
shouted.</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"I say that is not true!"</p>

<p>The man drew himself up.</p>

<p>"It certainly is true, sir."</p>

<p>"It is not! Will you tell the truth to me&mdash;or
to the police?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
"I have nothing to tell," the man insisted
doggedly.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont appeared to be beside himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Dieu!</i>" he cried, "if any harm has come
to Mr. Tranter, you shall pay for it&mdash;all of
you!"</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I can only repeat, sir, that I have not seen
Mr. Tranter, and that, so far as I know, he has
not been to this house. He is certainly not
here now. You are welcome to search every
room for him if you like. Mr. Copplestone
left word that the house was to be open to any
one who might wish to go over it."</p>

<p>"He said that?" Monsieur Dupont exclaimed,
his anger giving place to astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont turned away without another
word, and walked slowly to the gates.
Reaching them, he stopped, and looked back.</p>

<p>"In the name of heaven," he muttered,
"what happened in that house last night?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
He went back to his car. Amazement and
anxiety were blended on his face. It was
plain that his calculations had received an unexpected
check, the meaning of which he could
not at present grasp. The sudden transformation
of the house and garden was a development
that had not entered into his scheme of
procedure. It presented him with an entirely
new and unlooked-for problem. After a moment's
indecision, he took out his pocket-book,
referred to an address, and gave it to his chauffeur.</p>

<p>During the return journey he sat with his
face between his hands, buried in thought.
When the car stopped before a house in Grosvenor
Gardens, he lifted his head slowly and
heavily, as if rousing himself from a stupor.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Astley-Rolfe, if you please," he said
to the footman who answered his summons.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Astley-Rolfe is not at home, sir."</p>

<p>"It is most important," said Monsieur Dupont.
"I wished to speak to her of a matter
connected with Mr. George Copplestone."</p>

<p>"She went away early this morning, sir."</p>

<p>"Away?" Monsieur Dupont repeated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
"With Mr. Copplestone."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont started back.</p>

<p>"With Mr. Copplestone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Just before eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"With Mr. Copplestone...."</p>

<p>"He came in his car, sir, and insisted on Mrs.
Astley-Rolfe getting up to see him. She went
away with him ten minutes afterwards, without
telling us where she was going or when
to expect her back."</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont's face had become blanker
and blanker. He stared at the man speechlessly
then turned from the door, and gazed
in a helpless fashion up and down the street.</p>

<p>"<i>Mille diables!</i>" he murmured, "what does
it mean...."</p>

<p>He got into his car again. He looked about
him like a man dazed by a heavy blow. Returning
to the Savoy, he went up to his room.</p>

<p>There was a telegram on the table. He
opened it, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The name was George Copplestone Winslowe,</p>
<p class="authorsc">Lessing."</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Monsieur Dupont uttered an extraordinary
sound. In a flash the gloom and uncertainty
that had held him gave place to a seething excitement.
Crushing the telegram into his
pocket, he rushed from the room. Two minutes
later he was on his way to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Inspector Fay was occupied with the
arrangement of the evidence to be presented
at the inquest on the body of
Christine Manderson. He disliked interruptions
when at work, but the appearance
of Monsieur Dupont banished his annoyance,
and called forth a smile of complacent triumph.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Monsieur Dupont, "you
know me well enough to be sure that I would
not mislead you?"</p>

<p>There was that in the look of him that caused
the smile to fade from the inspector's face.</p>

<p>"Of course," he replied, laying down his
papers.</p>

<p>"There is not a moment to lose. You must
come with me."</p>

<p>"Come with you?"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;immediately."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
"But where?"</p>

<p>"Wherever it may be necessary to go. I
do not yet know myself. I only know that we
must go."</p>

<p>"Impossible," the inspector declared. "I
must be ready for the inquest."</p>

<p>"If you do not come with me," Monsieur
Dupont retorted, "you will not be ready for
the inquest." He allowed his excitement to
overflow. "Why do you stand there?" he
cried. "I tell you, there is not a moment to
lose. Cannot you see that I am serious? In
all the years that you have known me I have
never been more serious. Come!"</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded the inspector
sharply.</p>

<p>"To discover the truth of the death of Christine
Manderson."</p>

<p>"The truth is discovered," returned the inspector,
looking down at his papers.</p>

<p>"The truth is <i>not</i> discovered," said Monsieur
Dupont.</p>

<p>"It is a perfectly clear case," the inspector
retorted. "There cannot be the smallest doubt
that Layton killed her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
"Layton did not kill her. At the beginning
I warned you to ignore the obvious. But you
did not. Layton is no more guilty of the crime
than you are."</p>

<p>"I am satisfied," the inspector said shortly.</p>

<p>"You must please yourself," said Monsieur
Dupont. "I cannot wait. There are two
lives to save&mdash;his and another. I came here
to keep my word to you. I promised that if
I succeeded in solving the mystery, I would
hand the rest to you. I do not want credit
from this affair. There is another meaning
in it for me. I am ready to hand the rest to
you, if you will come and take it. If you will
not come&mdash;I must go on to the end myself.
The choice is to you."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay looked at him steadily for a
moment. Then he turned back to his desk,
and locked up his papers.</p>

<p>"I will come," he said.</p>

<p>They swung out from Scotland Yard
into Whitehall.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" the inspector
asked.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont leant forward, controlling
his excitement with an effort.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," he said, "I wish I knew!"</p>

<p>He took the telegram from his pocket.</p>

<p>"It is an hour only that I have returned from
Richmond. I found the house of George
Copplestone in course of transformation. I
found all the windows open. I found men and
women cleaning&mdash;painting&mdash;making new. I
found a hundred men ... making the crooked
garden straight."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the inspector&mdash;"why not?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont brought his hands together
impatiently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
"Why not? There are a thousand reasons
why not. But the reason why...."</p>

<p>"Is it an extraordinary thing for a man to
open his windows, paint his house, and
straighten his garden?"</p>

<p>"It is!" exclaimed Monsieur Dupont. "It is
more than an extraordinary thing&mdash;it is a
gigantic, a brain-splitting thing&mdash;if he has kept
his windows closed, his house unpainted, and
his garden crooked for twenty years. The
house of a man is the reflection of his soul.
It was the reflection of George Copplestone's
soul yesterday. But ... something happened
in it last night. And to-day...."</p>

<p>He broke off, and began to smooth out the
telegram on his knee.</p>

<p>"The moment I entered that house," he continued,
"I knew it was a wicked house. And
when that dreadful thing happened, I felt positively
that the wickedness of the house had
some direct connection with the crime in the
garden. I felt that it would be impossible to
solve one without solving the other. I knew,
also, that you would certainly be satisfied with
the evidence against James Layton, and would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
consider no other possibility. That evidence, I
admit, was unanswerable&mdash;but I, with some
previous knowledge to help me, knew that Layton
was innocent. The difficulty in front of
me was to prove the guilt of the real criminal
in time. My friend Tranter, and that remarkable
young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of Layton, Jenny West,
agreed to help me. Together we began to
draw the nets, and the criminal was aware of
our movements. In the country yesterday I
discovered the identity of the most important
witness in the case&mdash;but when I went to find
her in the evening, she had been snatched away.
I instructed Tranter to discover and bring to
me the secret of the Crooked House, whatever
it might be. He set out to do so at nine o'clock
last night. And he has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Disappeared?" the inspector exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Without a trace. I, only, knew where he
was going. And not only has he disappeared&mdash;but
Copplestone and Mrs. Astley-Rolfe have
disappeared with him."</p>

<p>Inspector Fay began to show more interest.</p>

<p>"They will be wanted for the inquest," he
said sharply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
"If we do not find them in time for the
inquest," Monsieur Dupont returned, "there
will be two inquests to hold."</p>

<p>"Two inquests?" the inspector echoed.</p>

<p>"I could not understand it," continued Monsieur
Dupont. "It was contrary to all my calculations.
I was bewildered&mdash;and you may
recollect that I am not often bewildered. But
when I returned to my hotel, I found this."
He held out the telegram. "It is the answer to
a certain inquiry I have made."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" the inspector asked,
handing it back.</p>

<p>"It means," said Monsieur Dupont slowly,
"that we shall be lucky if we find Tranter
alive."</p>

<p>"Where can they have gone?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I can only guess&mdash;and
if I have not guessed rightly, we shall not see
him again."</p>

<p>"Are you telling me," the inspector demanded,
"that Copplestone killed the woman
he had just become engaged to?"</p>

<p>"I shall tell you who killed her within twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
hours," Monsieur Dupont replied. "I will tell
you why she was killed now."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"Why," he asked, "did the murderer, whoever
it was, kill her so horribly? Why was it
not enough to deprive her of life? Could one
have desired more? Why was she stamped
on, and torn, and crushed?"</p>

<p>"It was obviously done in the madness of
jealousy and revenge," replied the inspector.</p>

<p>"It was done in madness," said Monsieur
Dupont&mdash;"but it was not the madness of jealousy
or revenge. It was the madness of a
strange and terrible hatred. It was done&mdash;because
the killer hated her beauty and not
her."</p>

<p>The inspector stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>"Hated her beauty, and not her...?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years ago," said Monsieur Dupont,
"there was in France a very beautiful woman.
She was named Colette d'Orsel. It was said
that she was the most beautiful woman in the
country. She was also very rich, very generous,
and very kind. She was always doing
good actions. She had not an enemy in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
world. There was no one who could have
wished her a moment's pain. She was only
twenty-five. With several of her friends she
went to stay at Nice. One night she was found
in the gardens of her hotel&mdash;almost torn to
pieces."</p>

<p>"I remember the case," said the inspector.
"It was a ghastly affair."</p>

<p>"There appeared no motive. She was wearing
some splendid jewels. They had been
crushed with her, but nothing was missing&mdash;not
a stone. She had just returned from the
tables, and had not troubled to deposit her
winnings of the evening with the cashier of the
hotel. Forty thousand francs were found on
the body. Not a note had been touched. The
greatest detectives of France were called in to
solve the mystery&mdash;but they solved nothing.
They made the mistake of trying to find a
motive. They looked for a person who could
have had a reason to kill her. But it was time
lost. They should have looked among the
people who had no reason to kill her. The
weeks became months, and still they discovered
nothing. That crime is a mystery to-day."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
The inspector's attention was rivetted. He
remained silent.</p>

<p>"Ten years ago," Monsieur Dupont proceeded,
"there was in Boston a young girl
named Margaret McCall. She was wonderfully
beautiful. Her parents were poor people,
and she worked for her living. She was quiet
and reserved by nature. She made few
friends, and cared little for the society of men.
Naturally there were hundreds who regretted,
and attempted to overcome, that characteristic;
but she went her own way quietly and
firmly. One evening her body was found in
a lonely part of one of the public parks torn
and crushed in the most terrible manner. The
police were helpless. The thing that baffled
them completely was the absence of any
motive for the crime. They tried to find one&mdash;but
all that they found was what I have said,
that she had been a good, honest girl&mdash;that
she had had no enemies&mdash;that she had not
jilted a man, or wronged a woman&mdash;that she
had never flirted, or encouraged men to pay
attentions to her. Yet there she had been
found&mdash;broken and mutilated. The small sum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
of money she carried had remained untouched.
The crime was never solved."</p>

<p>His voice had sunk lower. He had dwelt
on each detail with impassive deliberation.</p>

<p>"This week, Christine Manderson&mdash;without
doubt the most beautiful woman of the three&mdash;was
found in that crooked garden at Richmond,
if possible in a more horrible condition
than either of the others."</p>

<p>"You mean," exploded the inspector, "that
the murderer of Colette d'Orsel at Nice twenty
years ago also killed Margaret McCall in
Boston ten years after?"</p>

<p>"I do," replied the low voice.</p>

<p>"And Christine Manderson here three days
ago?"</p>

<p>"And Christine Manderson here three days
ago. But this time there was a difference.
An unfortunate chain of circumstances provided
clear evidence against an innocent man&mdash;James
Layton. I admit that as the case
stood you had no option but to arrest him.
But in doing so you committed the same mistake
that your French and American brothers
had committed before you. They had looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
for a motive, and could not find one. You
found a motive, and devoted yourself to the
man with the motive. You should have looked
for the Destroyer."</p>

<p>There was something of awe in the silence
that followed, like the hush that succeeds the
passing of a storm.</p>

<p>"My friend," said the inspector slowly,
"what utterly monstrous thing are you telling
me?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont turned to him a face of
massive innocence.</p>

<p>"Is it monstrous?" he said mildly. "If a
man is born with a longing to kill elephants,
he is a daring sportsman. If the longing is
to kill beetles, he is a scientist. But if the
inclination is to kill men&mdash;or women&mdash;he is a
criminal lunatic. Why? If the desire to kill
is not in itself monstrous, the desire to kill
a particular thing, whatever it may be, cannot
be monstrous. It can only be illegal. If it
is dreadful to kill a young child, it must be
dreadful to kill anything young. If it is
cowardly for a man to kill a woman, it is
cowardly for a man to kill the female sex in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
any shape or form. Yet, what scientist allows
the matter of sex to interfere with the impalement
of his beetle? Nor would he do so if
his hobby were to impale human beings. If
he searches for a beautiful beetle to kill, it
only requires a broadening of his particular
outlook for him to search for a beautiful
woman to kill. There may be a perfectly sane
and moral country in the world (although I
have never heard of it) in which it would be
criminal to kill the beetle, and scientific to kill
the woman. I confess that a well-mounted
collection of beautiful women would be very
much more interesting to me than the finest
collection of beautiful beetles. But if I have
the one, I am made a member of a Royal
Society&mdash;and if I have the other, I am executed.
And the only reason for that is that
the human beings make the laws, and not the
beetles."</p>

<p>The car swung round a sharp corner, and
the inspector's amazement was interrupted by
the sudden necessity of keeping his position.
Monsieur Dupont continued slowly.</p>

<p>"But the monstrousness of this case is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
that three people have been killed&mdash;but that
three people have been more than killed. It
is monstrous because we have none of the
simple dignity of the primitive slayer, and all
the morbid excesses of the modern despoiler.
While it might be an entirely respectable thing
to kill a woman to preserve her beauty, it is an
entirely monstrous thing to kill her to destroy
it. That is the only reason why the collector
of beetles and butterflies is not the most cold-blooded
of murderers. That is the only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What in the name of all that's unholy,"
gasped the inspector, "are you going to say
next?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Dupont leant forward as the car
stopped, and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Next," he replied gravely, "I am going to
inform you that we have arrived at Paddington,
and request you to get out."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monsieur Dupont's Task</span></p>


<p>He bought the tickets, and conducted
the inspector to a train.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" demanded
the bewildered officer, as
Monsieur Dupont settled himself in a corner,
and produced his cigar case.</p>

<p>"We are going," said Monsieur Dupont, "to
a delightful little village, hidden away in the
hills of the country&mdash;far from the sins of cities&mdash;where
they do not even know that Paris is the center of the world."</p>

<p>Fortunately they had the carriage to themselves.
Monsieur Dupont smoked in silence
for some minutes.</p>

<p>"I will explain to you," he began, at last,
"how I came to be concerned in this affair.
The reason was that, after my retirement, I
had the honor to marry a cousin of Colette
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
d'Orsel. The brother of my wife had been
one of the party at Nice at the time of the
crime, and, though there was not the least
evidence against him, the police had allowed
it to be known that they looked upon him as
the guilty person. You know how ready certain
people are to discuss and even to credit the
wildest theories&mdash;and you know also that after
sufficient discussion the wildest theories become
not only possibilities, but probabilities. The
cloud of suspicion hung over him, ruining his
health and his life, and casting a shadow over
the whole family. When I married my wife,
I determined that the shadow should be removed.
And for the past two years I have devoted
myself to that object.</p>

<p>"You can imagine," he went on, after a
pause, "the difficulties that confronted me.
Eighteen years had elapsed since the crime had
been committed. Men, women, and even
buildings, had passed, and been replaced&mdash;records
had been lost&mdash;memories failed. But
money, perseverence, and imagination slowly
conquered. Step by step the years were overcome.
With the aid of a small army of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
assistants, I succeeded in isolating a certain
person. I placed that person beside the dead
body of Colette d'Orsel, and began my pursuit.
<i>Mon Dieu</i>, how I worked! After the hardest
year of my life, I at last established a link
between the death of Colette d'Orsel and the
death of Margaret McCall&mdash;and that link was
the personality I had isolated in the first place
at Nice. But it had changed itself. I followed
scent after scent&mdash;trail after trail.
When I came to London a few days ago, I
had sufficient information to allow me to commence
the final stage of the adventure. I had
solved the most difficult question of all&mdash;the
present identity of my quarry. The second
most difficult question remained to be solved&mdash;proofs
of guilt. How could I obtain them?
How could I prove that this person&mdash;living
here in all the security of time&mdash;was the person
who had torn those two women to pieces in
America and France ten and twenty years ago?
I had certain clues to follow up, but the results
could not possibly have been sufficient to prove
such an accusation. What was I to do? To
rely upon observation? To search for&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
wait for&mdash;a proof in this person's daily intercourse
with the world? To place a beautiful
woman within reach, and watch for a betrayal?
That was actually the object in my mind when
I called on my friend Tranter, and requested
him to open to me the doors of London society.
Sooner or later, I should have found, or
brought about, the situation I was looking for.
It might have been years&mdash;doubtless it would
have been years&mdash;if he had not, by the most
remarkable chance, taken me direct to that
house at Richmond. Then came the death of
Christine Manderson. It was horrible&mdash;appalling!
And to think that I, who had detected
and tracked the Destroyer, had been
there in the same garden, within a few yards
of the third death, and yet was no nearer my
proofs! And to add to my difficulties, there
was the certainty that an innocent man would
suffer unjustly if I could not succeed in time."</p>

<p>He paused, looking grimly out at the passing
scenery.</p>

<p>"And if I had not sent Tranter to the
Crooked House yesterday, I do not know how
I could have succeeded in time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
He turned abruptly from the window, put
his feet up on the seat, and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am a little tired," he said. "If you will
excuse me, I will take a nap."</p>

<p>He slept for an hour.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They got out at a small country station.
The shadows of the hot twilight were merging
into darkness. A few minutes walking
brought them to an inn, at which Monsieur
Dupont demanded, and obtained, a conveyance.</p>

<p>For half an hour they drove through the
heavily scented air of the country. Scarcely
a word was spoken until they reached another
village. There, Monsieur Dupont requested
the inspector to alight and they proceeded on
foot.</p>

<p>The red rear-light of a motor-car appeared
at the turn of a corner. Monsieur Dupont
drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"<i>Le bon Dieu</i> be thanked!" he muttered.</p>

<p>The car was stationary and empty. Monsieur
Dupont laid a hand on the radiator.</p>

<p>"It is hot," he said. "They have only been
here a few minutes. Do not make a sound."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
He opened a gate. The long low shape of a
house was in front of them. They stood still,
listening. There was no sound, no light.</p>

<p>"To the back," Monsieur Dupont whispered.</p>

back a pair of French windows were
open, but heavy curtains were drawn
across them. No light was visible.
They listened. A voice was speaking&mdash;slowly,
scarcely above a whisper, but a whisper of contemptuous
pride.</p>

<p>"Yes," it said, "I am the Destroyer! I was
born to kill. It was the curse of my birth."</p>

<p>The silence of the room was broken only by
the faint sound of a woman sobbing. Monsieur
Dupont and the inspector drew nearer
to the window.</p>

<p>"You fools!" said the arrogant voice.
"What are your laws of Right and Wrong
to me? I <i>am</i> Right and Wrong. What are
your Codes of Sin? I <i>am</i> Sin. Who are you
to judge me? Who are you to set your little
laws against My Madness?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
There was a long pause. Then the voice
continued, in a tone of dull bitterness.</p>

<p>"Ever since I had strength to break, I have
broken&mdash;to tear, I have torn. The disease
took command of me long before I knew its
meaning. When I was a child the sight of
pretty things frightened me. I used to shrink
from them, and hide my face. I was only quiet
and normal when there were plain, colorless
things about me. As I grew older the fear
developed into hatred&mdash;and with hatred grew,
slowly and subtly, the inclination to destroy.
At first the opposition of all that was normal
in me sufficed to keep the desire in check, but
day by day it grew stronger and stronger, and
day by day the power to resist became less and
less. The increase of the hatred into madness
followed the growth of the impulse towards the
first surrender. It came upon me for the first
time when I was twelve. How well I remember
that day! My sanity had fought its strongest
battle, and my head was still throbbing and
swimming with the strain of it. I was taken
to a strange house, and left alone in a bright
room. On the wall there was a picture of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
very beautiful woman. I couldn't take my
eyes off it. I couldn't move from in front of
it. New passions, that I had never felt before,
were tearing me. The picture seemed to be
alive, to be mocking me. I hated it. I felt
that it was cruel and loathsome&mdash;that it had
wronged me. My whole body was on fire&mdash;my
brain was flaming. Then something seemed to
snap in my head. I lost myself. Irresistible
forces took possession of me, and used me.
When I came to myself ... the picture was
lying at my feet ... in fragments."</p>

<p>The voice settled down into an expressionless
monotone, pursuing its story without emotion.</p>

<p>"From that moment my doom lay on me.
I had made the initial submission. Any attempt
at resistance after that was futile. I
was helpless. Out of my hatred of beauty in
any shape or form came the desire to obtain
the most beautiful things I could find to enjoy
the mad ecstasy of shattering them. I had all
the morbid secret longing to induce attacks of
my own madness&mdash;to enjoy the awful exaltation,
the triumph of destruction. I was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
ashamed. I found myself entirely without
scruple, without conscience, incapable of remorse.
When the periods of desire were upon
me, I hesitated at nothing to gratify them.
At first they were frequent&mdash;sometimes there
were only a few days between&mdash;but as I grew
older the intervals lengthened, until sometimes
I dared to think myself free. But, sooner or
later, it came again. I knew all the warning
signals&mdash;the creeping in of uncontrollable
thoughts&mdash;the brain pictures&mdash;the quickening
of mind and body&mdash;then the grip of the madness.
All I could do at such times was to
collect a number of things sufficiently beautiful
to satisfy my lust, and lock myself in to an
orgy of destruction. Then I was normal again
for another period. So I grew up. When I
was twenty, I learnt the truth."</p>

<p>"I told him," a woman's broken voice said.
"I hadn't the heart to tell him before. I was
hoping against hope that the curse would pass
away as he grew into manhood. But when I
saw that it would not ... I told him."</p>

<p>"Then I knew there was no escape," the dull
voice went on. "The results of my father's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
vices and my mother's madness were my inheritance.
God! ... what a legacy!"</p>

<p>The voice flamed for an instant&mdash;then subsided
again into its previous monotony.</p>

<p>"The intervals became longer and longer,
but each time the madness recurred it tightened
its clutches. Each time it made me more and
more its own property. Whenever the warnings
showed themselves I fled to the refuge
of Miss Masters's house. She bought and
kept there things on which, when the mania was
at its height, it satisfied me to expend my lust.
But those inanimate things, though sufficient
for that purpose, had no power in themselves to
produce an attack of the madness. The capability
to do that was reserved to a woman's
beauty&mdash;the effect of which, so far, I had had
no opportunity to experience. That opportunity
came to me for the first time at Nice&mdash;twenty
years ago. I had never seen a really
beautiful woman before I saw Colette d'Orsel."</p>

<p>Another pause followed the name. The
room behind the curtains remained in tense
silence until the voice resumed.</p>

<p>"I can remember it now&mdash;as if it were yesterday.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
How she stood there&mdash;in the soft
shaded light&mdash;terribly beautiful. And I&mdash;the
Destroyer&mdash;watched her paralyzed&mdash;knowing
for the first time the pinnacle of my madness.
The sight of her numbed all my sanity. I
could no more have torn myself away from
that place than I could have resisted the new
flood of my disease that broke over me like a
nightmare wave. I was introduced to her.
As I bent over her hand I almost laughed at
the thought of what her horror would have
been if she had known the impulses that surged
through me. Her voice&mdash;the touch of her&mdash;burnt
into me like flames. I knew what the
end would be, but I was powerless in the grip
of my inheritance. And she&mdash;in the pitiless
irony of it&mdash;liked me! Three evenings later
I met her in the gardens of the hotel. We sat
together ... alone for the first time. I
struggled. My God, I struggled! But it was
useless. The white shape of her next to me&mdash;the
dim outline of her features&mdash;the whole
nearness of her beauty.... Then it came on
me, as I knew it would&mdash;the final rush of irresistible
hatred. When I knew myself again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
... she was lying on the ground ...
smashed ... my first living victim."</p>

<p>The woman sobbed.</p>

<p>"God forgive him!" she cried. "He was
innocent himself. It wasn't really him...."</p>

<p>Light footsteps moved across the floor.</p>

<p>"Let me be," said the voice hardly. "What
God does with me is for God to do. Sit down
again."</p>

<p>The footsteps returned.</p>

<p>"I left her there, and went back to the hotel.
I sat down in my room, and analyzed my feelings.
The madness had left me. My mind
was perfectly clear and steady. I felt no horror
at what I had done&mdash;no remorse&mdash;only a
sense of impersonal regret at the death of an
innocent woman, and a faint detached pity for
her misfortune in crossing my path. I carefully
considered my position, and certainty
that there could be no evidence against me dispelled
any fears for myself&mdash;but my cold-blooded
sanity realized that the odds were tremendously
against a recurrence of the same
good fortune, and that the avoidance of the
opposite sex must become the chief care of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
life. Then I went to bed, and slept soundly.
The discovery of Colette d'Orsel's body early
the next morning provided the sensation of the
year at Nice. The police were confounded.
There was no motive&mdash;no clue. It is an unsolved
mystery to-day."</p>

<p>The callousness of the story was so revolting
that even the inspector, seasoned as he was,
allowed a muttered expression of disgust to
escape him. But Monsieur Dupont remained
as silent and still as the house itself.</p>

<p>"Ten years later," continued the voice, "I
went to America. For five years I had been
free from any return of the madness. You
can imagine the longing to be like other men&mdash;to
presume on the years of immunity. I felt
unshakably sane. I even felt that I had never
been mad. I gloried in the keenness of my
intellect, the absolute order and control of my
thoughts. What had I to do with madness?
But in Boston ... I saw Margaret McCall.
In an instant I was mad. In an instant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A cry tore the air&mdash;a cry so awful in its
inhuman fury that the two listeners shrank
back horrified. For a moment the room
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
seethed with confusion. The voices of men
and women were blended in rage, terror, and
command. Then the curtains were wrenched
aside, and two figures rushed out shrieking into
the darkness of the garden.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Beauty-Killer</span></p>


<p>Four more figures dashed out through
the curtains&mdash;two women and two
men. The inspector and Monsieur
Dupont joined them. Guided by the
sounds in front of them, they dashed across
the garden at the top of their speed.</p>

<p>A black wall of earth loomed up before them,
like the rising of a gigantic wave. It was
strongly rivetted, and must have been at least
ten feet high. It was quite inaccessible from
where the pursuers stopped beneath it.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" a woman screamed.</p>

<p>They looked up.</p>

<p>"My God!" the inspector exclaimed.</p>

<p>On the height above them, silhouetted
against the pale sky of the summer night, they
saw a figure&mdash;its arms uplifted in an attitude
of majesty, of triumphant defiance. The white
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
light of the moon lit up a face terrible beyond
words in its pride, its sin, and its utter madness.</p>

<p>"I am the Beauty-Killer! I killed Colette
d'Orsel! I killed Margaret McCall. I killed
Christine Manderson...."</p>

<p>Another figure scrambled up out of the darkness
on to the height, and the silver head of
Oscar Winslowe gleamed in the light. For
a moment he crouched&mdash;then sprang forward
with a yell. The two figures swayed backwards
in a fierce struggle.</p>

<p>"They will go down!" a man's voice cried.
"It is the edge of a gravel pit. The fence
will not bear. There is a sheer drop of fifty
feet."</p>

<p>"Let them go," another woman sobbed. "It
is the best way."</p>

<p>And, even as she spoke, there was the sound
of tearing woodwork. The struggling figures
stood out for an instant with startling clearness&mdash;then
disappeared like the sudden shutting
off of a moving picture. And the whole
night seemed to wince at the thud that followed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
"We must go down," the man's voice said,
breaking the silence in an awestruck whisper.
"There is a way round the other side."</p>

<p>They followed him round the edge of the pit.
It seemed like walking round the world. They
descended a steep slope&mdash;and then, in the vast
gray silence, a circle of pale faces surrounded
the dead bodies of Oscar Winslowe, and John
Tranter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Last Truths</span></p>


<p>"My friends," said Monsieur Dupont,
"you have already heard a
great part of the story. John
Tranter was the son of Oscar
Winslowe. He was mad. He was, as he
called himself truly, a Beauty-Killer. That
strange lust he inherited from his mother, who
had been robbed of all she cared for, and hoped
for, in life by a beautiful woman, and rendered
insane three months before his birth. It was
a most pathetic tragedy. We shall now
hear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," Inspector Fay interrupted.
"As I represent the police here, I should be
glad to know, before we go any further, whose
house I am in."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," Monsieur Dupont apologized.
"I had forgotten. You are in the house of
Doctor Lessing," he inclined himself towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the doctor, "who will in due course repeat to
you a statement which he made to me yesterday.
This lady is Miss Masters, who was
Tranter's nurse. Mrs. Astley-Rolfe and Mr.
Copplestone&mdash;which, I fancy, is not his correct
name&mdash;you know already."</p>

<p>He added a high compliment to the inspector's
present position and past achievements,
and then turned to Copplestone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Copplestone, when Tranter did not
return to me at the appointed time this afternoon,
I went to your house. I found great
changes. I found it, as you say, upside down."</p>

<p>Copplestone was radiant with happiness.
Every trace of the old gloom had left him.
He was a new man.</p>

<p>"I should think you did!" he retorted. "And
you'd have found the earth upside down as
well, if I'd been able to turn it."</p>

<p>"I was puzzled," Monsieur Dupont admitted.
"I could not understand it. But I knew this&mdash;that
when the shadows roll away from a man's
house, they roll away from his life. When he
draws the blinds and throws open the windows
of his house to the light and the air, he draws
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the blinds and throws open the windows of his
soul. When he straightens his garden, he
straightens himself. I knew that before you
would lift the cloud from your house something
must have lifted the cloud from you. You had
been delivered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was a fellow in the Bible," said Copplestone&mdash;"I
think he was a king&mdash;who was
cured of leprosy by taking a dip in a river.
I don't know what happened afterwards, but I
am quite sure that he turned his palace upside
down when he got back."</p>

<p>He sprang up, his face illuminated with all
the wonder of his new birth.</p>

<p>"I am free!" he cried. "Free! That's what
my house told you. I had been brought out
into the light after half a life of darkness. I
had been released after forty years of prison,
of torment that all the tortures of the Inquisition
at once couldn't have equalled!"</p>

<p>He stared about him, like an intoxicated man.</p>

<p>"This room is too small!" he almost shouted.
"Everything is too small. I want to dance on
the Universe. I want the world to be a football.
I want to play enormous games with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
giants&mdash;" He checked himself abruptly, and
sat down. "Forgive me," he said. "You
would understand, if you knew what I have
suffered."</p>

<p>"I can, for one," agreed the doctor heartily.</p>

<p>"And I, indeed," said Monsieur Dupont.
"But to proceed with the story&mdash;I think it
would be better to commence with what Miss
Masters has to tell us."</p>

<p>He bowed to a gray-haired, grief-stricken
woman. There was a pause before she overcame
her emotion sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p>"I took charge of Mary Winslowe's child
from its birth," she began, at last. "She entrusted
it to me in her sane moments, and I
kept my trust faithfully. Perhaps it would
have been better if I had not."</p>

<p>"You did your duty," the doctor said.</p>

<p>"It was a condition that he should never
come under his father's influence, or even know
his real name. He was to be kept in complete
ignorance of the tragedy of his birth. It was
necessary for him to be christened in his proper
name to legalize the inheritance of his mother's
fortune, but after that I took him away, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
brought him up in strict accordance with my
promises. He was told that both his parents
had been drowned at sea. I gave him the name
of John Tranter&mdash;Tranter was an old family
name of mine. He was a bonny little fellow.
I never thought that he might have inherited
his mother's madness."</p>

<p>"The Laws of Nature are inexorable," said
the doctor. "If only the Second Commandment
were given to people as the Law of
Nature instead of the threat of God, it would
be of some value."</p>

<p>"I hardly realized it," she went on, "even
when the symptoms had unmistakably developed.
But it increased too plainly to be denied.
I hoped and prayed that the horrible disease
would pass away from him as he grew up&mdash;but
it grew stronger and stronger with him.
At last he made me tell him what it really was.
It was against my promise, but he had to know.
I pledged my word that I would keep his secret,
and it was arranged that whenever he felt the
approach of an attack he would come to me. I
kept things for him. At first smaller things
satisfied him. He was content to destroy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
flowers, pictures, prettily colored china, anything
that was beautiful. But after that visit
to France, when he was twenty, there was a
change. He never told me what had happened&mdash;that
he had killed a woman&mdash;but from that
time only a woman's beauty would satisfy him.
The attacks became few and far between, but
when they came he would have died with the
very force of his madness if he had not had
some representation of a beautiful woman to
expend it on."</p>

<p>"It's frightful&mdash;incredible," the inspector exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It was all the more pitiful," she said, "because
his sanity was so wonderful. He had
a towering intellect. He succeeded in anything
he put his hand to."</p>

<p>"He was looked upon as one of the greatest
authorities on finance in the country," said the
inspector.</p>

<p>"He could have been a Member of Parliament
before he was thirty if he had cared for
politics. He refused a title. To be a Privy
Councillor was the only honor he accepted.
And he&mdash;one of England's great men&mdash;came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
to my little house at Streatham to gratify his
madness to destroy."</p>

<p>She looked round at them defiantly, anger
displacing the sorrow on her face.</p>

<p>"But he was not guilty," she declared. "His
hands may have killed those three women&mdash;but
he was not guilty. Nor was that poor innocent
woman, his mother, who died in the madhouse.
They were both clean of sin. It was on his
wicked father that the guilt lay. It was Oscar
Winslowe who was responsible for the lives
that have fallen to his sins. Oscar Winslowe,
and no one else."</p>

<p>"I bear witness to that," agreed Doctor
Lessing. "Mary Winslowe was the gentlest,
the sweetest, and the most patient woman that
ever walked this earth, as you will see when I
tell you my story. And he was the biggest
blackguard that ever blasphemed the likeness
of his Maker."</p>

<p>"It is true," said the woman.</p>

<p>She drew back in her chair, and pressed a
hand to her forehead.</p>

<p>"That is all I have to tell you," she concluded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
"Last night," said Monsieur Dupont, "I
called at your house, and was told by the lady
who lives next door that you had left in a
hurry two hours before."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"I presume that you did so on instructions
from Tranter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Evidently he shadowed me to Paddington
Station, as I expected he would, and decided
to remove you in case I should get on the right
track."</p>

<p>"He sent me an urgent message," she said,
"saying that a great disaster hung over his
head, and that I must go away without leaving
any trace. He told me where to go, and promised
to come to me and explain."</p>

<p>"He knew that it was only you who could
give any proof against him?"</p>

<p>"After forty years," she returned, with a
touch of bitterness, "he ought to have known
that I should not betray him."</p>

<p>"Even if one had told you of those three
dreadful crimes that he had committed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
that an innocent man was accused of the last
one?"</p>

<p>She locked her hands together.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," she cried. "I don't know
what I should have done."</p>

<p>"He foresaw that problem," said Monsieur
Dupont. "His sanity was, as you have said,
wonderful. But the sanity of madness is
always wonderful&mdash;that is why madmen are
such superb criminals. It is only a madman
who can be really sane. Although I allowed
him to see that I knew already something of
the truth, he never betrayed himself by even a
tremor. He had all the grand egotism of the
born criminal. His disguise was impenetrable.
He was never sure how far my knowledge
went, but not a sign of anxiety did he ever
show. We played a game of cross purposes.
I used him, under the pretense of requiring
his assistance, to keep him by my side, and in
the hope that as he saw me draw nearer to him
step by step, he would break down. He, on
his side, allowed himself to be used in order to
keep watch on my moves, and safeguard himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
against them, as he did in the case of
Miss Masters. He dared not leave me. In all
my conversations with him, I placed him more
and more at his wit's end to know how much I
really knew. As much from curiosity as from
anything, I instructed him to discover the
secret of Mr. Copplestone's house, for I was
convinced that it did contain an interesting
secret. He was quite willing to make the
attempt. It did not promise to lead me any
nearer to him. He little thought when he
went&mdash;and I had little thought when I sent
him&mdash;that he was going to his own undoing."</p>

<p>"And my salvation," Copplestone added.</p>

<p>"There," said Monsieur Dupont, "it passes
to you to enlighten me."</p>

<p>"First," returned Copplestone, "I should
like to know what caused you to be so positive,
after being in my house only two or three
hours, that there was a secret in it."</p>

<p>"My instinct for the mysterious is seldom
at fault," said Monsieur Dupont. "Have you
not observed how, by their characters, their
habits, and their desires, human beings draw
to themselves certain events and conditions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
life? And it is equally true that houses draw
to themselves certain contents and certain
kinds of inhabitants. If a house is particularly
adapted to contain a secret, in the course
of time will certainly contain one. By a few
strokes of his pencil an architect can condemn
a house to become the scene of a murder, as
surely as he can make it a convenient or inconvenient
dwelling. Your house was constructed
to hide a secret. And I was not only sure that
it did hide one, but that it hid one which was
in some way connected with the crime in the
garden."</p>

<p>"I have had some experience of that instinct
of yours," the inspector remarked, with a
somewhat rueful smile.</p>

<p>"Well," said Copplestone, "instinct or no
instinct, it certainly did hide a secret, and that
secret was that Oscar Winslowe lived in it&mdash;if
his condition could be called living. For the
last five years he had been practically a helpless
imbecile. He seldom uttered a sound beyond
a gibber, and hardly seemed to be conscious.
He was suffering the natural consequences of
his vices. He had been gradually reaching
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
that condition since nature had dealt him her
first stroke of vengeance more than thirty
years ago. One by one his faculties had rotted.
He was a living mass of decay."</p>

<p>"It was a sure thing," the doctor said.
"Such a condition was bound to come. I
prophesied it to his face when I first knew him."</p>

<p>"That was the secret of my house," Copplestone
proceeded. "My own secret was that I
believed myself to be his son&mdash;the inheritor of
the curse that really belonged to Tranter.
And the horror of it, the helplessness, the constant
contemplation of the awful state of the
man I knew as my father, and the morbid
certainty that sooner or later I must come to
the same state, actually drove me to the madness
that was not really in me at all."</p>

<p>"But how had you come to believe yourself
to be his son?" the inspector asked.</p>

<p>"That was the last of Winslowe's diabolical
acts. He inherited a large fortune on condition
that a child of his, to whom it could
succeed, was alive at the time of the testator's
death. He did not know anything of his own
child, and did not want to. He was afraid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
that if he made public inquiries for it, he
might learn publicly that it was dead, and lose
his claim. Also, he was afraid of other complications
and exposures."</p>

<p>"And with good reason," said the doctor
grimly.</p>

<p>"He wanted a child of five to produce as
his son, George Copplestone Winslowe&mdash;and
possibly make away with in due course after
the business was settled. I am quite sure that
would have been my fate if nature had not
come to my rescue by striking him. He knew,
from his knowledge of the underworld of London,
how such things could be arranged without
risk. No doubt he bought me for a few
pounds. I am not the first heir to an estate
who has been produced by such means."</p>

<p>"True enough," agreed the inspector. "The
heir to a million has been bought for a fiver."</p>

<p>"But a few years after taking possession of
the fortune, he was struck down, as I have said,
by the first instalment of nature's retribution,
and was incapable of carrying out his plans.
No one cared for me. No one thought of removing
me from the sight and influence of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
growing imbecility. I was brought up under
the shadow of it. And so the horror was born
in me&mdash;the belief that I was mad. What
chance had I to resist it, in those surroundings?
When I came to an age to do so, I
searched out the story of my birth, of my
father's excesses and my mother's madness,
and my doom crashed upon me. Can you wonder
that I became what I was?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Monsieur Dupont.</p>

<p>"I dropped the name of Winslowe. It was
loathsome to me. I used my other two names,
George Copplestone. They, at least, had come
from my mother's side. My old manservant
and his wife stuck to me, and kept my secrets.
The income devolved on me in consequence of
Winslowe's incapability. And so things went
on. In my morbid demoralization I saw myself
growing nearer and nearer to that wretched
creature day by day."</p>

<p>"Dreadful!" shuddered the doctor. "It
must have been a living hell."</p>

<p>"Then, last night, Tranter came. He
climbed up on the ivy, and tried to spy into
Winslowe's room. But I was there, and heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
him. I dragged him in through the window.
I suppose it was some look, some likeness to
his mother, that stirred Winslowe's memory.
He recognized him, and a flash of sanity came
back to him. Under that sudden mental
stimulation he recovered his power of movement,
and was able to confess at least a part
of the truth. Tranter was taken off his guard,
and I forced him to admit his madness. I compelled
him to take Winslowe and myself to Miss
Masters, and she, in her turn, brought us here."</p>

<p>"I imagined she would," Monsieur Dupont
remarked.</p>

<p>Copplestone drew a deep breath, and laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>"And I am like other men! I can live as
other men live. I can do what other men do.
I can&mdash;&mdash;" His eyes rested on the woman
beside him, and his face grew tender. "Yes,"
he repeated slowly, "I can ... I can...."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"And it was Tranter who killed Christine
Manderson...." the inspector said, almost to
himself.</p>

<p>"It was," said Monsieur Dupont. "He admitted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to you on the night of the crime that
he had known her in America years ago. And
here we have a curious study in conflicting
emotions. When he first met her, he had
already killed two beautiful women. She was
certainly more beautiful than either&mdash;yet he
was able to associate with her on intimate
terms for a considerable time, and even to tear
himself away from her at last, without adding
her to the victims of his madness. How was
he able to do that? It was undoubtedly
because he loved her. He had not loved either
of the other two, so there had been no opposing
emotion to his mania. But he loved Christine
Manderson, and love was capable of holding
the madness in check, because love, in its full
strength, is the strongest of all human emotions.
Love is stronger than madness, and
ten times stronger than sanity. But after he
left her the love faded to a certain extent,
while the madness increased. Therefore,
when he was suddenly confronted with her
extraordinary beauty a few nights ago, the
love that had faded was unable to restrain the
madness that had not. And he killed her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
"My God!" exclaimed Copplestone, "to think
that he stood there with us over the body he
had torn&mdash;and even lifted it into my arms&mdash;without
so much as a quiver."</p>

<p>"He was not capable of remorse or regret,"
Monsieur Dupont returned. "If he had been,
he would have killed himself long ago." He
paused. "There remain now a few points of
my own part in this affair to tell you, and we
will then ask the doctor for his statement."</p>

<p>"Before you do that," said Doctor Lessing,
bluntly, "I, for one, am curious to know who
you really are, and how you came to take such
a large hand in the whole business."</p>

<p>"My connection with the whole business,"
replied Monsieur Dupont, "is a long story.
I have already told it to Inspector Fay, and
I will tell it again with pleasure when all the
more important statements have been made.
As regards myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Fay took upon himself the continuation
of the sentence.</p>

<p>"Up to a few years ago," he said, "Monsieur
Dupont was, under a certain pseudonym, the
most brilliant member of the French Secret
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Service&mdash;and was, in fact, admitted to have no
equal in the whole of Europe."</p>

<p>"A gross exaggeration, my friends," protested
Monsieur Dupont. He waved the inspector
to silence. "When I came to London
last week," he told them, "I came knowing
that John Tranter had killed two women. I
had known that when I returned from America
six months before. You can imagine the difficulties
in front of me then. I was to prove
that an English Privy Councillor, a well-known
and highly respected man, was in reality a
madman who was responsible for two of the
most dreadful crimes that had ever been committed.
I had never seen him, but fortunately
he was in Paris at that time, and I had no
difficulty in making his acquaintance. By
extreme good fortune, I was able to render
him a service in the streets which placed him
under an obligation to me. I observed him
carefully, only to find him to all appearances
the sanest and most level-headed man I had
ever met. But there was one thing&mdash;he shut
himself away completely from the society of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
women, and he avoided all places where beauty
was to be found in any form. But I was so far
from any proof. My next step was to test my
own belief that his madness was an inherent
disease, and to do that I employed inquiry
agents in this country to discover whether there
were any records of such a case in existence.
It is only two weeks since I received information
from them that a woman named Mary
Winslowe had died in an asylum from that
very kind of madness, forty years ago."</p>

<p>"That is true," corroborated the doctor.</p>

<p>"I came to London immediately. While
following up my clues, I renewed my acquaintance
with Tranter, and pressed him to act as
my cicerone in London society, hoping to be
able to entrap him into a situation that would
lead him to betray himself. And he took me to
Richmond. What happened there, you know.
Though he knew when Christine Manderson
first came into the room what the outcome
would be, he was unable to tear himself away.
And in the garden she forced herself upon him.
He tried to resist her, but his madness overcame
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
him. That is the explanation of the
absence of a cry for help, which once I stated
to be the key to the mystery. If she had been
walking along that path to the house, she
would have had time to cry out, no matter
how quickly the assailant had sprung out at
her. But she did not utter a cry because she
was already in the arms of the assailant, compelling
him to a passionate embrace, and without
doubt it was a simple thing to strangle her
silently in that very position."</p>

<p>"Good God!" Copplestone shuddered.</p>

<p>"His account of how she had asked him to
find Mr. Copplestone, and tell him she was not
well, and of how he had left her on her way to
the house, was a succession of ingenious lies
which could not be disproved. That is my
story," concluded Monsieur Dupont. "The
next most important point at the moment is
that James Layton is cleared of a charge from
which he could not possibly have saved himself."</p>

<p>"Layton will be released with full honors
to-morrow," the inspector said.</p>

<p>"And I think," added Monsieur Dupont,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
"that there will be another matter&mdash;not unconnected
with a young lady named Jenny
West&mdash;upon which we shall have to congratulate
him&mdash;and with very good reason."</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, when the
doctor's statement had been made,
Copplestone and Mrs. Astley-Rolfe
stood together in the flower-laden
garden.</p>

<p>"My dear," said the new man, "I brought
you here to witness my deliverance. Yesterday,
when you had left me, I made up my mind
to put an end to my life. To-day I am free.
The cloud has rolled away. I am fit to keep
my promise&mdash;if you wish it kept."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him through happy tears.</p>

<p>"If I wish it kept!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Copplestone exclaimed, "I believe
in every miracle that has ever been reported,
suggested, or hinted at, from the first
hour of the world!"</p>
